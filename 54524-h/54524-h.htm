<h3>TO DR. TILLOTSON.</h3>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Our</span> next meeting at Sir <span class="smcap">John Maynard’s</span>
was on the evening of that day, when the war
was proclaimed against <i>France</i><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>. What the
event of it will be, is a secret in the counsels
of Providence. But if the goodness of our
cause, his Majesty’s known wisdom and ability,
and, above all, the apparent zeal and firmness
of all orders amongst us in support of this
great undertaking, may give a prospect of
success, we cannot, I persuade myself, but
indulge in the most reasonable hopes and
expectations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>Perhaps, the time is approaching, my dear
friend, which the divine goodness hath decreed
for putting a stop to that outrageous power,
which hath been permitted for so long a course
of years to afflict the neighbouring nations.
It may be, the season is now at hand, when
God will vouchsafe to plead the cause of his
servants, and let this mighty persecutor of the
faithful know that he may not be suffered any
longer to trample on the sacred rights of conscience.
He may be taught to feel, that the
ravages he hath committed in the fairest provinces,
and the cruelties he hath exercised on
the best subjects, of his own kingdom, have
at length awakened the divine displeasure
against him. And he may live to find in our
great prince (raised up, as I verily believe, to
this eminence of place and power to be the
scourge of tyrants, and the vindicator of oppressed
nations) an insurmountable bulwark
against that encroaching dominion, which
threatens to deform and lay waste the rest of
<i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p>I have already lived to see those providences,
which may encourage a serious and good mind
to believe that some great work is preparing in
our days. I was very early in my life a witness
to the high measures which were taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
and carried on by an intolerant hierarchy,
acting in subserviency to an arbitrary court,
in mine own country of <i>Scotland</i>. And I
have lamented the oppression in which good
men were held for conscience sake in all the
three kingdoms. How far this tyranny was
carried, and how near we were brought to the
destruction of all our civil and religious rights,
need not be told, and the occurrences of the
two last reigns will not suffer to be forgotten.
It is sufficient to observe, that when the danger
was now brought to a crisis, and the minds
of all men were filled with the most alarming
apprehensions, it pleased God to rescue us, in
a moment and by the most astonishing display
of his goodness, from the impending ruin.
Our chains fell off at once, as by a miracle of
mercy. Our civil rights have been restored.
And the legal toleration<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>, we have just now
obtained in consequence of the new settlement,
hath put us into possession of that religious
liberty, which, as men, as Christians, and as
Protestants, we cannot but esteem the first of
all public blessings.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>And who knows but that, in the gracious
designs of Heaven, the same hand which hath
redeemed these nations from the yoke of
slavery and of <i>Rome</i>, may be now employed
to shake it off from the necks of our Protestant
brethren on the continent<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>? The world
hath seen how long and how severely they
have groaned under that intolerant power, with
which we are now at war. When the violences
of the late reign had driven me into a sort of
voluntary exile, and in the course of it I traversed
some of those unhappy provinces of
<i>France</i>, which were most exposed to the rigours
of persecution<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>, how have these eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
wept over the distresses of the poor sufferers,
and how hath my heart bled for the merciless
cruelties which I every where saw exercised
upon them! The fury which appeared on
that occasion, was so general and so contagious,
that not only priests and court sycophants,
but men of virtuous minds and generous
tempers, were transported, as it were,
out of their proper nature, and seemed to
divest themselves of the common notices and
principles of humanity.</p>

<p>In this fiery trial it hath pleased God to
exercise the faith and virtues, and, as we may
charitably hope, to correct the failings and
vices, of his poor servants. His mercy may
now, in due time, be opening a way for them
to escape. And from the prosperous beginning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
of this great work, what comfortable
presages may we not, in all humility, form to
ourselves of still further successes?</p>

<p>We have a prince on the throne exactly
qualified for the execution of this noble enterprise;
of the clearest courage and magnanimity,
and a wisdom tried and perfected in
that best school, of Adversity; of dispositions
the most enlarged to the service of mankind;
and even quickened by his own personal resentment
of former injuries to retaliate against
their common oppressor.</p>

<p>Nor can we doubt of the concurrence of his
faithful subjects, who, with one voice, have
demanded the commencement of this war; and
whose late deliverance, from like circumstances
of distress, may be expected to animate their
zeal in the support of it.</p>

<p>And oh! that I might see the day, when
our deliverer shall become, what a bold usurper
nobly figured to himself in the middle of this
century<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>, the soul and conductor of the Protestant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
cause through all <i>Europe</i>! and, that,
as <i>Rome</i> hath hitherto been the centre of
slavish impositions and anti-christian politics,
the court of <i>England</i> may henceforth be the
constant refuge and asylum of fainting liberty
and religion!</p>

<p>But to turn from these flattering views, my
good friend, to the recital of our late conversation;
which I proceed to lay before you with
the same exactness and punctuality that I did
the former. You will see the reason why I
cannot promise you the same entertainment
from it.</p>

<p>We had no sooner come together, than Sir
<span class="smcap">John Maynard</span> began with his usual vivacity.</p>

<p>I have been thinking, my lord, how dexterous
a game I have played with you, in this
inquiry of ours into the <i>English</i> government.
What was obvious enough in itself, and had
indeed been undertaken by many persons, I
mean the vindication of our common liberties
as founded in the ancient feudal constitution,
is the part I assumed to myself in this debate;
and have left it to your lordship to reconcile
the <small>FACT</small> to the <small>RIGHT</small>: which is not only the
most material point of inquiry, but the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
difficult, and that which the patrons of liberty
have either less meddled with, or have less
succeeded in explaining. For, to own an unwelcome
truth, however specious our claim
may be to civil liberty, the administration of
government from the time of <span class="smcap">Henry VII</span>’s accession
to the crown, that is, for two entire
centuries, has very little agreed to this system.
The regal power, throughout this period, has
been uniformly exercised in so high and arbitrary
a manner, that we can hardly believe
there could be any certain foundation for the
people’s claim to a limited monarchy. Add to
this, that the language of parliaments, the decrees
of lawyers, and the doctrines of divines,
have generally run in favour of the highest
exertions of prerogative. So that I cannot but
be in some pain for the success of your undertaking,
and am at a loss to conjecture in what
way your lordship will go about to extricate
yourself from these difficulties.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>I understand, Sir John, that your intention
in setting forth the difficulties of this attempt
is only, in your polite way, to enhance the
merit of it. I must not however assume too
much to myself. The way is clear and easy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
before me. You have conducted us very
agreeably through the rough and thorny part
of our journey. You have opened the genius
of our ancient constitution. You have explained
the principles on which it was raised.
All that remains for me is, only to solve
doubts, and rectify appearances; a matter of
no great difficulty, when, instead of groping
in the dark, we are now got into open daylight,
and are treading in the paths of known
and authentic history.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>And yet, my lord, I shall very readily acknowledge,
with my Lord Commissioner, the
importance of the service. For, unless appearances
be strangely deceitful indeed, there
is but too great reason to conclude, from the
recent parts of our history, either that there
never was a rightful claim in the people to civil
liberty, or that they, as well as their princes,
had lost all sense of it. I doubt, the most
your lordship can make appear, is, that as our
kings, from the coming of the Tudor line, had
usurped on the ancient privileges of the subject;
so the subject, at length, in our days,
has, in its turn, usurped on the undisputed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
and long-acknowledged prerogative of the sovereign.
In short, I doubt there is no forming
a connected system on these subjects; but that
in our country, as well as in others, liberty
and prerogative have prevailed and taken the
ascendant at different times, according as either
was checked or favoured by contingent
circumstances.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>Still Mr. Somers, I see, is on the desponding
side: and with better reason than before;
since, if the difficulty be half so great as is
pretended, this change of the speaker is little
favourable to the removal of it. However, I
do not despair, whether these surmises of difficulty
be real or dissembled, to clear up the
whole matter to both your satisfactions. The
stress of it lies here: That, whereas a mixed
and limited government is supposed to have
been the ancient constitution in this country,
the appearances, in fact, for a couple of centuries,
have been so repugnant to this notion,
that either the supposition must be given up as
too hastily formed, or sufficient reasons must
be assigned for these contradictory appearances.
I embrace the latter part of this alternative
without hesitation or reserve; and pretend to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
lay before you such unanswerable arguments
for the cause I have undertaken, as, in better
hands, might amount to a perfect vindication
of <span class="smcap">English Liberty</span>.</p>

<p>I take my rise from the period which my Lord
Commissioner has prescribed to me; that is,
from the accession of the <span class="smcap">Tudor</span> family.</p>

<p>We have henceforth, indeed, a succession
of high despotic princes, who were politic and
daring enough to improve every advantage
against the people’s liberties. And their peculiar
characters were well suited to the places in
which we find them. <span class="smcap">Henry VII.</span> was wise
and provident; jealous of his authority as well
as title; and fruitful in expedients to secure
both. His son and successor, who had a spirit
of the largest size, and, as one says<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>, <i>feared
nothing but the falling of the heavens</i>, was admirably
formed to sustain and establish that
power, which the other had assumed. And
after two short reigns, which afforded the people
no opportunity of recovering their lost
ground, the crown settled on the head of a
princess, who, with the united qualifications
of her father and grandfather, surpassed them
both in the arts of a winning and gracious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
popularity. And thus, in the compass of a
century, the prerogative was now wound up to
a height, that was very flattering to the views
and inclinations of the <span class="smcap">Stuart</span> family.</p>

<p>It may be further observed, that the condition
of the times was such as wonderfully conspired
with the designs and dispositions of these
princes.</p>

<p>A long and bloody war, that had well nigh
exhausted the strength and vitals of this country,
was, at length, composed by the fortunate
successes of <i>Bosworth-field</i>. All men were desirous
to breathe a little from the rage of civil
wars. And the enormous tyranny of the prince,
whose death had made way for the exaltation
of the earl of <span class="smcap">Richmond</span>, was a sort of foil to
the new government, and made the rigours of
it appear but moderate when set against the
cruelties of the preceding reign.</p>

<p>The great change that followed, in the deliverance
of the nation from papal tyranny, and
the suppression of religious houses, was a new
pretence for the extension of the royal prerogative;
and the people submitted to it with pleasure,
as they saw no other way to support and
accomplish that important enterprise.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>And, lastly, the regal power, which had
gained so immensely by the rejection of the papal
dominion, was carried still higher by the
great work of reformation; which being conducted
by a wise and able princess, was easily
improved, on every occasion, to the advantage
of the crown.</p>

<p>And thus, whether we consider the characters
of the persons, or the circumstances of the
times, every thing concurred to exalt the
princes of the house of <span class="smcap">Tudor</span> to a height of
power and prerogative, which had hitherto been
unknown in <i>England</i>, and became, in the end,
so dangerous to the constitution itself.</p>

<p>But you expect me, I suppose, to point to
the very examples of usurpation, I have in view,
and the means by which it took effect in the
hands of these and the succeeding princes.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>We do indeed expect that from your lordship.
For otherwise it will be thought that
what you treat as an usurpation, was but the
genuine exercise of the regal authority; only
favoured by fortunate conjunctures, and, as
you say, by great ability in the princes themselves.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>Perhaps, still more will be expected. For
it may not be enough to tell us, what usurpations
there were, or even by what means they
became successful. It should further appear,
methinks, that these usurpations, though they
suspended the exercise of the people’s liberties,
did not destroy them; did not, at least, annihilate
the Constitution from which those liberties
were derived.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>All this will naturally come in our way, as
we go along. And, since you will have me
usurp the chair on this occasion, and, like the
princes I am speaking of, take to myself an
authority to which I have no right, let me presume
a little on my new dignity; and, in what
follows, discourse to you, as our manner is,
without interruption or reply.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>This, it must be owned, is carrying the prerogative
of the chair to its utmost height. But,
if we submit to it in other places, is it reasonable
you should require us to do so here? Besides,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
your lordship forgets that I am too old
to be a patient hearer. And Mr. <span class="smcap">Somers</span> too&mdash;</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>I can engage, in this instance, for passive
obedience. And my lord, perhaps, does not
insist on the full extent of his prerogative. It
is fit, however, we attend with reverence, while
such an advocate is pleading in such a cause.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>I was saying, that all your demands would
be satisfied, as I went along in this discourse.
It is true, an attentive reader of our history,
who considers what is said of the mixed frame
of our government, and the struggles that were
occasioned by it, is surprised to find that these
contentions at once subsided on the accession
of the house of <span class="smcap">Tudor</span>; and that the tenour of
the government thenceforth for many successions
is as calm, and the popular influence as
small, as in the most absolute and despotic
forms. This appearance tempts him to conclude,
that the crown had at length redeemed
itself from a forced, unconstitutional servitude;
and that, far from usurping on the people, it
only returned to the exercise of its old and
acknowledged rights. For otherwise it will be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
said, how could the people at once become so
insensible, and their representatives in parliament
so tame, as to bear with the most imperious
of their princes without reluctance; they,
who had resented much smaller matters from
the gentlest and the best?</p>

<p>But those, who talk in this strain, have not
considered, that there were some circumstances
in the state of things, from the time we are
speaking of, that <small>DISABLED</small> the nation from
insisting, and many more that <small>INDISPOSED</small> them to insist, on their ancient and undoubted
rights.</p>

<p>I took notice, that the ruinous contentions
of the two houses of <span class="smcap">York</span> and <span class="smcap">Lancaster</span>,
from which the nation was at last delivered by
the accession of <span class="smcap">Henry VII.</span> disposed all men
to submit with satisfaction to the new government.
Such a conjuncture was favourable, of
itself, to the increase of the regal power. But
the truth is, there was little danger of any successful
opposition to the crown, if the nation
had been ever so ill inclined towards it. The
great lords or barons were, in former days,
both by the feudal constitution, and by the
vast property they had in their hands, the proper
and only check on the sovereign. These
had been either cut off, or so far weakened at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
least by the preceding civil wars, that the danger
seemed entirely over from that quarter.
The politic king was aware of his advantage,
and improved it to admiration. One may even
affirm, that this was the sole object of his government.</p>

<p>For the greater security, and majesty of his
person, he began with the institution of his
<small>LIFEGUARD</small>. And having thus set out with enlarging
his own train, his next care was to diminish
that of his nobles. Hence the law, or
rather laws (for, as Lord <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> observes, there
was scarcely a parliament through his whole
reign which passed without an act to that purpose)
against <span class="smcap">Retainers</span>. And with how jealous
a severity he put those laws into execution,
is sufficiently known from his treatment
of one of his principal friends and servants, the
earl of <span class="smcap">Oxford</span><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>.</p>

<p>It was also with a view to this depression of
the nobility, that the court Of <span class="smcap">Star-chamber</span>
was considered so much, and confirmed by act
of parliament in his reign: “That which was
principally aimed at by it being, as his historian
frankly owns, <span class="smcap">Force</span>, and the two chief
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
supports of Force, <small>COMBINATION OF MULTITUDES</small>,
and maintenance of <small>HEADSHIP OF GREAT
PERSONS</small>.”</p>

<p>To put them still lower in the public estimation,
he affected to fill the great offices with
churchmen only. And it was perhaps, as much
to awe the nation by the terror of his prerogative
as to fill his coffers, that he executed the
penal laws with so merciless a rigour on the
very greatest of his subjects.</p>

<p>Still further to prevent the possibility of a
return, in any future period, of the patrician
power, this politic prince provided with great
care for the encouragement of trade, and the
distribution of property. Both which ends
were effected at once by that famous act, which
was made to secure and facilitate the alienation
of estates by fine and proclamation.</p>

<p>All these measures, we see, were evidently
taken by the king to diminish the credit and
suppress the influence of his nobles; and of
consequence, as he thought, to exalt the power
of the crown above control, if not in his own,
yet in succeeding ages. And his policy had
this effect for some time; though in the end
it served, beside his expectation, to advance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
another and more formidable power, at that
time little suspected or even thought of, the
<small>POWER OF THE PEOPLE</small><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>.</p>

<p>The truth is, <span class="smcap">Henry</span>’s policy was every way
much assisted by the genius of the time. Trade
was getting up: and Lollardism had secretly
made its way into the hearts of the people.
And, though <i>liberty</i> was in the end to reap the
benefit of each, <i>prerogative</i> was the immediate
gainer. Commerce, in proportion to its growth,
brought on the decline of the feudal, that is,
aristocratic power of the barons: and the authority
of the church, that other check on the
sovereign, was gradually weakened by the prevailing
spirit of reformation.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, <span class="smcap">Henry</span> found it
no difficulty to depress his great lords; and he
did it so effectually, that his son had little else
left him to do, but to keep them down in that
weak and disabled state, to which his father
had reduced them. ‘Tis true, both he and his
successors went further. They never thought
themselves secure enough from the resistance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
of their old enemies, the barons<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>; and so continued,
by every method of artifice and rapine,
to sink them much lower than even the safety
of their own state required. But the effects of
this management did not appear till long afterwards.
For the present, the crown received a
manifest advantage by this conduct.</p>

<p>There was, besides, another circumstance of
great moment attending the government of the
younger <span class="smcap">Henry</span>. He was the first heir of the
white and red roses: so that there was now an
end of all dispute and disaffection in the people.
And they had so long and so violently contended
about the title to the crown, that, when
that mighty point was once settled, they did
not readily apprehend that any other consideration
deserved, or could justify, resistance to
their sovereign.</p>

<p>With these advantages of situation, <span class="smcap">Henry
VIII.</span> brought with him to the throne a spirit
of that firm and steady temper as was exactly
fitted to break the edge of any rising opposition.
Besides the confidence of youth, he was of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
nature so elate and imperious, so resolved and
fearless<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>, that no resistance could succeed,
hardly any thought of it could be entertained
against him. The commons, who had hitherto
been unused to treat with their kings but by
the mediation of the great lords, being now
pushed into the presence, were half discountenanced
in the eye of majesty; and durst
scarcely look up to the throne, much less dispute
the prerogatives with which so awful a
prince was thought to be invested.</p>

<p>And when the glaring abuse of his power, as
in the exaltation of that great instrument of his
tyranny, <span class="smcap">Wolsey</span>, seemed afterwards to provoke
the people to some more vigorous resolutions,
a singular event happened, which not
only preserved his greatness, but brought a further
increase to it. This was the famous rupture
with the court of <i>Rome</i>: in consequence
of which, the yoke of papal usurpations, that
yoke under which our kings had groaned for
so many ages, was in a moment broken off,
and the crown restored to its full and perfect
independency.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p>Nor was this all. The throne did not only
stand by itself, as having no longer a dependence
on the papal chair. It rose still higher,
and was, in effect, erected upon it. For the ecclesiastical
jurisdiction was not annihilated, but
transferred; and all the powers of the <i>Roman</i>
pontiff now centered in the king’s person.
Henceforth then we are to regard him in a more
awful point of view; as armed with both swords
at once; and, as <span class="smcap">Nat. Bacon</span> expresses it in his
way, as a strange kind of monster, “A king
with a pope in his belly<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>.”</p>

<p>The remainder of his reign shews that he
was politic enough to make the best use of what
his passions had brought on, and thus far accomplished.
For though the nation wished,
and, without doubt, hoped to go much further,
the king’s quarrel was rather with the court,
than the church of <i>Rome</i>. And the high authority
in spirituals, which he had gained,
enabled him to hold all men, who either feared
or desired a further reformation, in the most
entire dependence.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the nation rejoiced with
great reason at its deliverance from a foreign
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
tyranny: and the lavish distribution of that
wealth, which flowed into the king’s coffers
from the suppressed monasteries, procured a
ready submission, from the great and powerful,
to the king’s domestic tyranny.</p>

<p>In a word, every thing contributed to the
advancement of the regal power; and, in that,
to the completion of the great designs of Providence.
The amazing revolution, which had
just happened, was, at all events, to be supported:
and thus, partly by fear, and partly
by interest, the parliament went along with the
king, in all his projects; and, beyond the example
of former times, was constantly obsequious
to him, even in the most capricious and
inconsistent measures of his government.</p>

<p>And thus matters, in a good degree, continued
till the accession of Queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.
It is true, the weak administration of a minor
king, and a disputed title at his death, occasioned
some disorders. But the majesty of
the crown itself was little impaired by these
bustles; and it even acquired fresh glory on
the head of our renowned Protestant princess.</p>

<p>For that astonishing work of reformation,
so happily entered upon by <span class="smcap">Henry</span>, and carried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
on by his son, was after a short interruption
(which only served to prove and animate
the zeal of good men) brought at length by
her to its final establishment. The intolerable
abuses and shameless corruptions of popery
were now so notorious to all the world, and
the spirit of reformation, which had been secretly
working since the days of <span class="smcap">Wickliff</span>, had
now spread itself so generally through the nation,
that nothing but an entire renunciation
of the doctrine and discipline of the church of
<i>Rome</i> could be expected. And, by the happiest
providence, the queen was as much
obliged by the interest of her government and
the security of her title, as by her own unshaken
principles, to concur with the dispositions
of her subjects.</p>

<p>Thus, in the end, Protestantism prevailed,
and obtained a legal and fixed settlement.
But to maintain it, when made, against the
combined powers that threatened its destruction,
the crown on which so much depended,
was to be held up in all its splendor to the
eyes of our own and foreign nations. Hence
the height of prerogative in <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>’s days,
the submission of parliaments, and, I may
almost say, the prostration of the people.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>And when this magnanimous princess, as
well by her vast spirit and personal virtues, as
the constant successes of her long reign, had
derived the highest dignity and authority on
the <i>English</i> sceptre, it passed into the hands
of the elder <span class="smcap">James</span>; who brought something
more with him than a good will, the accession
of a great kingdom, and the opinion of deep
wisdom, to enable him to wield it.</p>

<p>What followed in his and the succeeding
reigns, I need not be at the pains to recount
to you. These things are too recent for me
to dwell upon: and you, my Lord Commissioner,
do not only remember them perfectly,
but have yourself acted a great part in most of
them. Allow me only to say, that from this
brief history of the regal authority, and the
means by which it arrived at so unusual a
greatness, it is no wonder that the <span class="smcap">Stuart</span> family
were somewhat dazzled by the height to
which they were raised, and that more than
half a century was required to correct, if it
ever did correct, the high but false notions
they had entertained of the imperial dignity.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>If you permit me, at last, to break in at the
opening which this conclusion of your discourse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
seems to give me; I would say, That,
on your principles, the house of <span class="smcap">Stuart</span> had
great reason for the high notions you ascribe
to them. For what other conclusion could
they make, but that a power, which had domineered
for so long a time, and that by the
full allowance of parliament and people, was,
both in fact and right, absolute and uncontrolable?</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>It is certain, the <span class="smcap">Stuart</span> family did draw that
conclusion. But a great deal too hastily; as
may appear from your own observation, that
the exercise of this extraordinary power was
committed, or more properly indulged to
them, by the people. This is so strictly true,
that from the first to the last of the <span class="smcap">Tudor</span>
line, imperious and despotic as they were of
their own nature, no extraordinary stretch of
power was ventured upon by any of them, but
under the countenance and protection of an
act of parliament. Hence it was, that the
<span class="smcap">Star-chamber</span>, though the jurisdiction of this
court had the authority of the common law,
was confirmed by statute; that the proceedings
of <span class="smcap">Empson</span> and <span class="smcap">Dudley</span> had the sanction of
parliament; that <span class="smcap">Henry</span> the VIIIth’s supremacy,
and all acts of power dependent upon it,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
had the same foundation: in a word, that
every thing, which wore the face of an absolute
authority in the king, was not in virtue of
any supposed inherent prerogative in the
crown, but the special grant of the subject.
No doubt, this compliance, and particularly if
we consider the lengths to which it was carried,
may be brought to prove the obsequious
and even abject dispositions of the times;
though we allow a great deal, as I think we
should, to prudence and good policy. But
then the parliaments, by taking care to make
every addition to the crown their <small>OWN PROPER
ACT</small>, left their kings no pretence to consider
themselves as absolute and independent.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>I doubt, considering the slavish disposition
of the times, that, if the people still possessed
a shew of liberty, this advantage was owing to
the pure condescension of the crown, and not
to their own policy. A king that could obtain
of his parliament to have his proclamations
pass for laws<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>, might have ventured on this
step without the concurrence of parliament.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>I acknowledge the act you glance at was of
an extraordinary kind; and might seem, by
implication at least, to deliver up the entire
legislative authority into the hands of the sovereign.
But there is a wide difference between
the crown’s usurping this strange power, and
the parliament’s bestowing it. The case was
(and nothing could be more fortunate for the
nation) that at the time when the people were
least able to controul their prince, their prince’s
affairs constrained him to court his people.
For the rejection of the papal power and the
reformation of religion were things of that
high nature, and so full of hazard, that no
expedient was to be overlooked, which tended
to make the execution of these projects safe or
easy. Hence it was, that no steps were taken
by the crown but with the consent and approbation
of the two houses. And if these were
compelled by the circumstances of their situation
to favour their prince’s interest or caprice
by absurd and inconsistent compliances, this
benefit at least they drew to themselves, that
their power by that means would appear the
greater and more unquestionable. For what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
indeed could display the omnipotency of parliaments
more than their being called in to
make and unmake the measures of government,
and give a sanction, as it were, to contradictions?
Of which there cannot be a
stronger instance than the changes they made
from time to time, as <span class="smcap">Henry VIII</span>’s passions
swayed him, in the rule of succession.</p>

<p>Thus we see that, through the entire reigns
of the house of <span class="smcap">Tudor</span>, that is, the most
despotic and arbitrary of our princes, the
forms of liberty were still kept up, and the
constitution maintained, even amidst the advantages
of all sorts which offered for the destruction
of both. The parliament indeed was
obsequious, was servile, was directed, if you
will; but every proceeding was authorised and
confirmed by parliament. The king in the
mean time found himself at his ease; perhaps
believed himself absolute, and considered his
application to parliaments as an act of mere
grace and popular condescension. At least,
after so long experience of their submission,
the elder <span class="smcap">James</span> certainly thought himself at
liberty to entertain this belief of them. But he
was the first of our princes that durst avow this
belief plainly and openly. He was stimulated,
no doubt, to this usurpation of power in <i>England</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
by the memory of his former subjection,
of servitude rather, to the imperious church of
<i>Scotland</i>. But this was not all. Succeeding
to so fair a patrimony as that of a mighty
kingdom, where little or no opposition had
been made for some reigns to the will of the
sovereign; to a kingdom too, securely settled
in the possession of its favoured religion, which
had occasioned all the dangers, and produced
all the condescension, of the preceding princes;
bringing, besides, with him to the succession,
an undisputed title and the additional splendor
of another crown; all these advantages meeting
in his person at that point of time, he ventured
to give way to his natural love of dominion,
and told the people to their face, that the pretended
rights of their parliaments were but the
free gifts and graces of their kings: that every
high point of government, that is, every point
which he chose to call by that name, was
wrapt up in the awful mystery of his prerogative:
and, in a word, that “it was sedition for
them to dispute what a king may do in the
height of his power<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>.”</p>

<p>Such, you know, was the language, the
public language to his parliaments, of <span class="smcap">James
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
the First</span>. But these pretences, which might
have been suffered perhaps, or could not have
been opposed, under the <span class="smcap">Tudor</span> line, were
unluckily out of season, and would not pass on
a people who knew their own rights, had saved
to themselves the exercise of them, and came
now at length to feel and understand their importance.
For, as I before observed, the
principal cause that had lifted the crown so
high, was the depression of the barons. The
great property which had made them so formidable,
was dispersed into other hands. The
nobility were therefore too low to give any
umbrage to the crown. But the commons
were rising apace; and in a century had grown
to that height, that on the accession of the
<i>Scotch</i> family, the point of time when the new
king dreamed of nothing but absolute sovereignty<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>,
they were now in a condition to assert
the public liberty, and, as the event
shewed but too soon, to snatch the sceptre
itself out of their king’s hands.</p>

<p>However, in that interval of the dormant
power of the commons it was, that the prerogative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
made the largest shoots, till in the
end it threatened to overshadow law and liberty.
And, though the general reason is to
be sought in the humiliation of the church,
the low estate of the barons, and the unexerted,
because as yet unfelt, greatness of the commons,
the solution will be defective if we stop
here. For the regal authority, so limited by
the ancient constitution, and by the continued
use of parliaments, could never in this short
space have advanced itself beyond all bounds,
if other reasons had not co-operated with the
state of the people; if some more powerful and
special causes had not conspired to throw
round the person of the sovereign those rays
of sacred opinion, which are the real strength
as well as gilding of a crown.</p>

<p>Of these I have occasionally mentioned several;
such as “the personal character and
virtues of the princes themselves; the high
adventurous designs in which they were engaged;
the interest, the people found or promised
to themselves in supporting their power;
the constant successes of their administration;
and the unremitting spirit and vigour with
which it was carried on and maintained.” All
these considerations could not but dispose the
people to look up with reverence to a crown,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
which presented nothing to their view but
what was fitted to take their admiration, or
imprint esteem. Yet all these had failed of
procuring to majesty that profound submission
which was  paid to it, or of elevating the prince
to that high conceit of independency which so
thoroughly possessed the imagination of King
<span class="smcap">James</span>, if an event of a very singular nature,
and big with important consequences, had not
given the proper occasion to both.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>I understand you to mean the overthrow of
the papal dominion, which had so long
eclipsed the majesty of our kings; and held
them in a state of vassalage, not only to the
triple crown, but, which was more disgraceful,
to the mitre of their own subjects.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>Rather understand me to mean, what was
indeed the consequence of that event, <small>THE
TRANSLATION OF THE POPE’S SUPREMACY TO
THE KING</small>. This, as I take it, was the circumstance
of all others which most favoured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
the sudden growth of the imperial power in
this nation. And because I do not remember
to have seen it enlarged upon as it deserves,
give me leave to open to you, somewhat copiously,
the nature of this newly-acquired
headship, and the numerous advantages which
the prerogative received from it.</p>

<p>The <small>PAPAL SUPREMACY</small>, as it had been
claimed and exercised in this kingdom, was a
power of the highest nature. It controlled
every rank and order in the state, and, in effect,
laid the prince and people together at the
mercy of the <i>Roman</i> pontiff. There is no need
to recount the several branches of this usurped
authority. It is enough to say, that it was
transcendant in all respects that could in any
sense be taken to concern religion. And who,
that has looked into the papal story, needs be
told that, by a latitude of interpretation, every
thing was construed to be a religious concern,
by which the pope’s power or interest could be
affected?</p>

<p>Under the acknowledgment then of this
super-eminent dominion, no steps could possibly
be taken towards the reformation of religion,
or even the assertion of the just rights
and privileges of the crown. But the people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
were grown to have as great a zeal for the former
of these considerations, as the king for
the latter. And in this juncture it was, that
<span class="smcap">Henry</span>, in a sudden heat, threw off the supremacy;
which the parliament, to prevent
its return to the pope, very readily invested in
the king.</p>

<p>There was something so daring, and, according
to the prejudices of that time, so
presumptuous and even prophane, in this attempt
to transfer the spiritual headship to a
secular power, that the pope himself little apprehended,
and nothing but the king’s dauntless
temper could have assured, the success of
it. The repugnancy which the parliament
themselves found in their own notions betwixt
the exercise of the spiritual and temporal
power, was the reason perhaps for inserting
in the act of supremacy those qualifying
clauses, we find in it<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>It is possible, as you say, that the parliament
might be at a loss to adjust in their own
minds the precise bounds of the spiritual jurisdiction,
as united to the civil, in the king’s
person. Yet, in virtue of these clauses, the
regal supremacy was, in fact, restrained and
limited by act of parliament: and the import
of them was clearly to assert the independency
of the crown on any foreign judicature, and
not to confer it in the extent in which it was
claimed and exercised by the see of <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>It is true, that no more was expressed, or
perhaps intended, in this act. But the question
is, how the matter was understood by the
people at large, and in particular by the king
himself and his flatterers. Now it seems to
me that this transfer of the supremacy would
be taken for a solemn acknowledgment, not
only of the ancient encroachments and usurpations
of the papacy, but of the king’s right
to succeed to all the powers of it. And I conclude
this from the nature of the thing itself,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
from the current notions of the time, and from
the sequel of the king’s government.</p>

<p>If we attend to the nature of the complaints
which the kingdom was perpetually making,
in the days of popery, of the <i>Roman</i> usurpations,
we shall find that they did not so much
respect these usurpations themselves, as the
person claiming and enjoying them. The
grievance was, that appeals should be made to
<i>Rome</i>; that provisions should come from
thence; in a word, that all causes should be
carried to a foreign tribunal, and that such
powers should be exercised over the subjects of
this realm by a foreign jurisdiction. The complaint
was, that the pope exercised these powers;
and not that the powers themselves were
exercised. So, on the abolition of this supremacy,
the act that placed it in the person of
the king, would naturally be taken to transfer
upon him all the privileges and pre-eminencies,
which had formerly belonged to it. And thus,
though the act was so properly drawn as to
make a difference in the two cases, yet the
people at large, and much more the king himself,
would infer from the concession, “that
the pope had usurped his powers on the crown;”
that therefore the crown had now a right to
those powers. And the circumstance of this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
translation’s passing by act of parliament, does
not alter the matter much, with regard to the
king’s notion of it. For in that time of danger,
and for the greater security of his new power,
he would chuse to have that ratified and confirmed
by statute, which he firmly believed inherent
in his person and dignity.</p>

<p>Then, to see how far the current opinions of
that time were favourable to the extension of
the regal authority, on this alliance with the
papal, we are to reflect, that, however odious
the administration of the pope’s supremacy was
become, most men had very high notions of
the plenitude of his power, and the sacredness
of his person. “<span class="smcap">Christ’s</span> vicar upon earth”
was an awful title, and had sunk deep into the
astonished minds of the people. And though
<span class="smcap">Henry</span>’s pretensions went no further than to
assume that vicarial authority within his own
kingdom, yet this limitation would not hinder
them from conceiving of him, much in the
same way as of the pope himself. They, perhaps,
had seen no difference, but for his want
of the pope’s <i>sacerdotal</i> capacity. Yet even
this defect was, in some measure<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>, made up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
to him by his <i>regal</i>. So that between the majesty
of the kingly character, and the consecration
of his person by this mysterious endowment
of the spiritual, it is easy to see how well
prepared the minds of men were, to allow him
the exercise of any authority to which he pretended.</p>

<p>And to what degree this spiritual character
of head of the church operated in the minds of
the people, we may understand from the language
of men in still later times, and even from
the articles of our church, where the prerogative
of the crown is said to be that which <small>GODLY
KINGS</small> have always exercised: intimating that
this plenitude of power was inherent in the
king, on account of that <i>spiritual and religious</i>
character, with which, as head of the
church, he was necessarily invested. The illusion,
as gross as we may now think it, was
but the same as that which blinded the eyes of
the greatest and wisest people in the old world.
For was it not just in the same manner, that
by the policy of the <i>Roman</i> emperors in assuming
the office of <i>pontifex maximus</i>, that is,
incorporating the religious with their civil character,
not only their authority became the
more awful, but their <i>persons</i> sacred?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>We see then, as I said, how conveniently
the minds of men were prepared to acquiesce
in <span class="smcap">Henry</span>’s usurped prerogative. And it is well
known that this prince was not of a temper to
balk their expectations. The sequel of his
reign shews that he took himself to be invested
with the whole ecclesiastical power, legislative
as well as executive; nay, that he was willing
to extend his acknowledged right of supremacy
even to the ancient papal infallibility, as appears
from his sovereign decisions in all matters
of faith and doctrine. It is true the parliament
was ready enough to go before, or at least to
follow, the head of the church in all these decisions.
But the reason is obvious. And I
need not repeat to you in what light the king
regarded their compliance with him.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>It is very likely, for these reasons, that the
king would draw to himself much authority
and reverence, at least, from his new title of
supremacy. But it does not, I think, appear
that the supremacy had all that effect on the
people’s rights and the ancient constitution,
which your lordship’s argument requires you
to ascribe to it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>I brought these general considerations only
to shew the reverend opinion which of course
would be entertained of this mixt person, <small>THE
SUPREME HEAD OF THE CHURCH</small>, compounded
of a king and a pope; and how natural a foundation
it was for the superstructure of despotic
power in all its branches. But I now hasten
to the particulars which demonstrate that this
use was actually made of that title.</p>

<p>And, first, let me observe, that it gave birth
to that great and formidable court of the <small>HIGH-COMMISSION</small>;
which brought so mighty an accession
of power to the crown, that, as experience
afterwards shewed, no security could be
had for the people’s liberties, till it was totally
abolished. The necessity of the times was a
good plea for the first institution of so dangerous
a tribunal. The restless endeavours of papists
and puritans against the ecclesiastical establishment
gave a colour for the continuance of it.
But, as all matters that regarded religion or
conscience were subjected to its sole cognizance
and inspection, it was presently seen how wide
an entrance it gave to the most tyrannical usurpations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p>It was, further, natural that the king’s power
in civil causes should keep pace with his authority
in spiritual. And, fortunately for the
advancement of his prerogative, there was already
erected within the kingdom another court
of the like dangerous nature, of ancient date,
and venerable estimation, under the name of
the court of <small>STAR-CHAMBER</small>; which brought
every thing under the direction of the crown
that could not so properly be determined in the
high-commission. These were the two arms
of absolute dominion; which, at different
times, and under different pretences, were
stretched forth to the oppression of every man
that presumed to oppose himself to the royal
will or pleasure. The star-chamber had been
kept, in former times, within some tolerable
bounds; but the high and arbitrary proceedings
of the other court, which were found
convenient for the further purpose of reformation,
and were therefore constantly exercised,
and as constantly connived at by the parliament,
gave an easy pretence for advancing the
star-chamber’s jurisdiction so far, that in the
end its tyranny was equally intolerable as that
of the high-commission.</p>

<p>Thus the king’s authority in all cases, spiritual
and temporal, was fully established, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
in the highest sense of which the words are capable.
Our kings themselves so understood it;
and when afterwards their parliaments shewed
a disposition to interfere in any thing relating
either to church or state, they were presently
reprimanded; and sternly required not to meddle
with what concerned their prerogative royal
and their high points of government. Instances
of this sort were very frequent in <small>ELIZABETH’S</small>
reign, when the commons were getting up, and
the spirit of liberty began to exert itself in that
assembly. The meaning of all this mysterious
language was, that the royal pleasure was subject
to no control, but was to be left to take its
free course under the sanction of these two supreme
courts, to which the cognizance of all
great matters was committed.</p>

<p>This, one would think, were sufficient to
satisfy the ambition of our kings. But they
went further, and still under the wing of their
beloved supremacy.</p>

<p>The parliament were not so tame, or the
king’s grace did not require it of them, to divest
themselves entirely, though it was much
checked and restrained by these courts, of their
legislative capacity. But the crown found a
way to ease itself of this curb, if at any time it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
should prove troublesome to it. This was by
means of the <small>DISPENSING POWER</small>; which, in
effect, vacated all laws at once, further than it
pleased the king to countenance and allow
them. And for so enormous a stretch of power
(which, being rarely exercised, was the less
minded) there was a ready pretence from the
papal privileges and pre-eminencies to which
the crown had succeeded. For this most invidious
of all the claims of prerogative had been
indisputable in the church; and it had been
nibbled at by some of our kings, in former
times, from the contagious authority of the
pope’s example, even without the pretence
which the supremacy in spirituals now gave
for it.</p>

<p>The exercise of this power, in the popes
themselves, was thought so monstrous, that
<span class="smcap">Matthew Paris</span> honestly complains of it in
his time, as <i>extinguishing all justice</i>&mdash;<small>EXTINGUIT
OMNEM JUSTICIAM</small><a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>. And on another occasion,
I remember, he goes so far, in a spirit
of prophecy, almost, as to tell us the ill use
that hereafter kings themselves might be
tempted to make of it<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>. His prediction was
verified very soon: for <span class="smcap">Henry III.</span> learned this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
lesson of tyranny, and put it in practice. On
which occasion one of his upright judges could
not help exclaiming, <span class="smcap">CIVILIS CURIA EXEMPLO
ECCLESIASTIC&AElig; CONQUINATUR</span><a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>. And afterwards,
we know, <span class="smcap">Henry VII.</span> claimed and
exercised this dispensing power in the case of
sheriffs, contrary to act of parliament<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>. It was
early indeed in his reign, and when the state
of his affairs was thought to give a colour to it.</p>

<p>I mention these things to shew, that since
the pope’s example had been so infectious in
former times, it would now be followed very
resolutely, when the translation of the very supremacy,
from which it had sprung, seemed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
to justify it. And we have a remarkable instance
in <span class="smcap">Elizabeth’s</span> reign, by which it may
appear that this prerogative was publickly and
solemnly avowed. For upon some scandal
taken by the popish party upon pretence that
the book of consecration of bishops was not
established by law, the queen made no scruple
to declare by her letters-patent, that she had,
by her supreme authority, dispensed with all
causes or doubts of any imperfection or disability
in the persons of the bishops. My learned
friend, Dr. <span class="smcap">Stillingfleet</span>, in commenting
this case, acknowledges the very truth. “It
was customary,” says he, “in the pope’s bulls,
to put in such kind of clauses; and therefore she
would omit no power in that case to which the
pope had pretended<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>.”</p>

<p>And it is in this dispensing spirit that <span class="smcap">James
I</span>, having delivered it for a maxim of state,
“that the king is above law,” goes on to affirm,
in one of his favourite works, that general
laws, made publickly in parliament, may,
upon known respects to the king, by his authority
be mitigated and <small>SUSPENDED</small> upon
causes only known to him<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p>We perceive the ground of that claim, which
was carried so high by the princes of the house
of <span class="smcap">Stuart</span>, and, as we have just seen, brought
on the ruin of the last of them. And to how
great a degree this prerogative of the dispensing
power had at length possessed the minds even
of the common lawyers, (partly from some
scattered examples of it in former times, and
partly from reasons of expediency in certain
junctures, but principally from the inveteracy
of this notion of the papal supremacy) we had
an alarming proof in <span class="smcap">Hale’s</span> case, when eleven
out of the twelve judges declared for it.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>Your lordship has indeed shewn that the
poison of the papal supremacy began to work
very fatally. If this blessed revolution had not
happened, what could have been expected but
that the next step would be, to set the crown
above all divine as well as human law? And
methinks, after such a judgment in <i>Westminster-Hall</i>,
it could not be surprising if another
set of men had served the king, in the office of
the pope’s janissaries, and maintained his right
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
of dispensing with the gospel itself<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>, as well as
the statute-book.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>I must needs think, Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>, you are a
little severe, not to say unjust, in this insinuation;
for which the churchmen of our days
have surely given you no reason. And as for
the reverend judges, methinks my lord of <i>Salisbury</i>
might be allowed to expose their determination,
at the same time that he so candidly
accounts for it.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>I perceive, my Lord Commissioner, with all
his goodness and moderation, is a little apt to
surmise the worst of our order. But I will try
to reconcile him to it; and it shall be in the
way he most likes, by making a frank confession
of our infirmities.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p>For another source of the regal dominion in
latter times, and still springing from out of the
rock of supremacy (which followed and succoured
the court-prerogative, wherever it went,
just as the rock of <span class="smcap">Moses</span>, the <i>Rabbins</i> say,
journeyed with the <i>Jewish</i> camp, and refreshed
it in all its stations) was the opinion taken up
and propagated by churchmen, from the earliest
&aelig;ra of the Reformation, concerning the
irresistible power of kings, and the <small>PASSIVE
OBEDIENCE</small> that is due to it.</p>

<h4>SIR. J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>Aye, there it is, I am afraid, that we are
principally to look for the origin of the high
pretences of our kings to absolute government.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>I shall dissemble no part of the clergy’s blame
on this occasion; and there is the less need, if
I were ever so tender of their reputation, as
their inducements to preach up this doctrine
were neither slight in themselves, nor unfriendly
to the public interest.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that the churchmen
especially, both by interest and principle,
would be closely connected with the new head
of the church. Their former subjection in spirituals
to the papal authority would of itself
create a prejudice in favour of it, as now residing
in the king’s person. And the disposal of
bishopricks and other great preferments being
now entirely in the crown, they would of
course, you will say, be much addicted to his
service.</p>

<p>But these were not the sole, or even the principal,
reasons that induced so wise and so disinterested
persons, as our first reformers, to
exalt the royal prerogative. They were led
into this pernicious practice by the most excusable
of all motives, in their situation, an
immoderate zeal against popery.</p>

<p>It is true, a very natural prejudice mixed itself
with their other reasonings. “The crown
had been declared supreme, and to have chief
government of all estates of this realm, and in
all causes.” And, though this declaration was
levelled only against the pretensions of every
foreign, and particularly the papal power, yet,
the clergy were given to conceive of it as a general
proposition. The reason was, that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
people, from whom the just right of supremacy
is derived, having, at this juncture, not yet attained
the consideration, which the nobles had
lost, they forwardly concluded, that if the
royal estate were independent of the pope, it
was unquestionably so of every other power.
They could not, on the sudden, be brought to
think so reverendly of the poor people, even
in their representatives, as to allow that they
had any pretension to restrain their sovereign.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>I could swear to the truth of this account.
One of the popes, I forget which, is said to
have called the deputies of the third estate in
<i>France</i>, on a certain occasion, <span class="smcap">Nebulones Ex
f&aelig;ce plebis</span><a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>. And though that might not
be the language of churchmen in England, at
this time, it was not far, perhaps, from expressing
their sentiments. It is certain, they
soon taught their princes, who put themselves
to school to the hierarchy<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>, to talk in this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
strain; as appears from many of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth’s</span>
and <span class="smcap">James’s</span> speeches to the commons.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>Something of this sort, I grant you, but not
in the degree you put it, might have an influence
on the political reasonings of the clergy.
But their zeal for reformation was what prevailed
with them most, and carried them furthest
into these notions. It is something curious
to see how this happened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry’s</span> usurpation of the supremacy, as it
was called at <i>Rome</i>, appeared so prodigious a
crime to all good Catholics, that no severities
were great enough to inflict upon him for it.
Their writers proceeded to strange lengths.
Even our cardinal <span class="smcap">Pole</span> so far forgot the greatness
of his quality, and the natural mildness
of his temper, as to exceed the bounds of decency,
in his invectives against him. And
when afterwards, in right of this assumed
headship, the crown went so far as to reject
the authority of the church as well as court of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
Rome, all the thunders of the Vatican were
employed against this invader of the church’s
prerogative. The pope, in his extreme indignation,
threatened to depose <span class="smcap">Edward</span>. He
did put his threat in execution against <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.
Yet, in spite of religious prejudices,
this was esteemed so monstrous a stretch of
power, and so odious to all Christian princes,
that the jesuits thought it expedient, by all
means, to soften the appearance of it. One of
their contrivances was, by searching into the
origin of civil power; which they brought
rightly, though for this wicked purpose, from
the people. For they concluded, that, if the
regal power could be shewn to have no divine
right, but to be of human and even popular
institution, the liberty, which the pope took
in deposing kings, would be less invidious.
Thus the jesuits reasoned on the matter. The
argument was pushed with great vigour by
<span class="smcap">Harding</span> and his brethren in <span class="smcap">Elizabeth’s</span>
reign, but afterwards with more learning and
address by <span class="smcap">Bellarmine</span>, <span class="smcap">Mariana</span>, and others<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>.</p>

<p>To combat this dangerous position, so prejudicial
to the power of kings, and which was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
meant to justify all attempts of violence on the
lives of heretical princes, the Protestant divines
went into the other extreme; and, to
save the person of their sovereign, preached
up the doctrine of <small>DIVINE RIGHT</small>. <span class="smcap">Hooker</span>,
superior to every prejudice, followed the truth.
But the rest of our reforming and reformed divines
stuck to the other opinion; which, as
appears from the <small>HOMILIES</small>, the <small>INSTITUTION
OF A CHRISTIAN MAN</small>, and the general stream
of writings in those days, became the opinion
of the church, and was indeed the received
Protestant doctrine.</p>

<p>And thus unhappily arose in the church of
England that pernicious system of divine indefeasible
right of kings: broached indeed by the
clergy, but not from those corrupt and temporizing
views to which it has been imputed.
The authority of those venerable men, from
whom it was derived, gave it a firm and lasting
hold on the minds of the clergy: And being
thought to receive a countenance from the general
terms, in which obedience to the civil
magistrate is ordained in scripture, it has continued
to our days, and may, it is feared, still
continue, to perplex and mislead the judgments
of too many amongst us.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>Yet it could hardly have kept its ground
against so much light and evidence as has been
thrown at different times on this subject<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>, but
for an unlucky circumstance attending the
days of reformation. This was, the growth
of puritanism and the republican spirit; which,
in order to justify its attack on the legal constitutional
rights of the crown, adopted the
very same principles with the jesuited party.
And under these circumstances it is not to be
thought strange that a principle, however true,
which was disgraced by coming through such
hands, should be generally condemned and
execrated. The crown and mitre had reason
to look upon both these sorts of men as their
mortal enemies. What wonder then they
should unite in reprobating the political tenets,
on which their common enmity was justified
and supported?</p>

<p>This I take to be the true account of what
the friends of liberty so often object to us,
“That the despotism of our later princes has
been owing to the slavish doctrines of the
clergy.” The charge, so far as there is any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
colour for it, is not denied: and yet I should
hope to see it urged against us with less acrimony,
if it were once understood on what grounds
these doctrines were taken up, and for what
purposes they were maintained by the clergy.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>Besides the candour of this acknowledgment,
the part, which our clergy have lately acted,
is, methinks, enough to abate and correct
those hard sentiments, which, as you say,
have been entertained against them.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>This apology seems indeed the best that can
be made for them. But when one considers
the baleful tendency of those doctrines, which
were calculated to enslave the very souls and
consciences of men, and by advancing princes
into the rank of gods, to abet and justify their
tyranny, one cannot help feeling a strong resentment
against the teachers of them, however
they might themselves be imposed upon
by several colourable pretences. Your lordship
knows, I might proceed to further and
still harder reflexions. But I have no pretence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
to indulge in them at this time, when a bishop
is pleading so warmly in the cause of liberty.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>This tenderness to your friends, Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>,
is very obliging. But I would willingly engage
your candour, in behalf of our order.
Let me presume, for such a purpose, to second
Mr. <span class="smcap">Somers’s</span> observation, “That the English
clergy have at length atoned, in some measure,
for former miscarriages.”</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>By their behaviour in a late critical conjuncture:
and yet, to speak my mind frankly,
the merit of their services, even on that occasion,
is a little equivocal, when one reflects
how unwilling they seemed to take the alarm,
till they were roused, at length, by their own
immediate object, the church’s danger!</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>And can you wonder that what concerned
them most, what they best understood, and
was their proper and peculiar charge, should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
engage their principal attention? Besides,
they went on principle, and with reason too,
in supposing that no slight or partial breaches
of law were sufficient to authorise resistance to
the magistrate<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>. But when a general attack
was made upon it, and the dispensing power
was set up in defiance of all law, and to manifest
the subversion of the constitution, the clergy
were then as forward as any others to signalize
themselves in the common cause of liberty.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>Their old favourite doctrine of <i>non-resistance</i>
was, I doubt, at the bottom of this cautious
proceeding. But it was high time for them to
lay it aside, when they saw it employed as the
ready way for the introduction of that popery,
which, as you say, it was its first intention to
keep out.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>It certainly was.&mdash;But, not to pursue this
argument any further, let me return to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
main point I had in view, which was, “to
account for the growth of the regal power
from the influence of the transferred supremacy.”
There is still another instance behind,
which shews how well our princes understood
the advantage they had gained, and
how dextrously they improved it.</p>

<p>It seems prodigious, at first sight, that when
the yoke of <i>Rome</i> was thrown off, the new
church, erected in opposition to it, should
still continue to be governed by the laws of the
old. The pretence was, that this was only by
way of interim, till a body of ecclesiastical
laws could be formed; and, to cover this pretence
the better, some steps were, in fact,
taken towards the execution of such a design.
But the meaning of the crown certainly was,
to uphold its darling supremacy, even on the
old footing of the <small>CANON LAWS</small>.</p>

<p>This conclusion seems probable, if one considers
that those canons proceeded from an
absolute spiritual monarch, and had a perpetual
reference to his dominion; that they were
formed upon the very genius, and did acknowledge
the authority of the civil laws, the
proper issue, as my Lord Commissioner has
shewn us, of civil despotism. Whoever, I say,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
considers all this, will be inclined to think that
the crown contrived this interim from the use
the canon law was of to the extension of the
prerogative. Accordingly it is certain, that
the succeeding monarchs, <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, <span class="smcap">James</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Charles,</span> would never suffer us to have a
body of ecclesiastical laws, from a sense of this
utility in the old ones; and a consciousness,
if ever they should submit a body of new laws
to the legislature, that the parliament would
form them altogether in the genius of a free
church and state<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>; and perhaps would be for
assuming a share in their darling supremacy
itself.</p>

<p>With those canon laws, and for the same
purpose, as was observed to us, these princes
retained a great affection for the interpreters of
them, the canon and civil lawyers; till the
genius of liberty rising and prevailing in the
end, over all the attempts of civil despotism,
both the one and the other fell into gradual
desuetude and contempt: and as the canonists
were little regarded, so their law is now considered
no further than as it is countenanced
and supported by the law of <i>England</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>But to see how convenient the doctrine of
the canon law was for the maintenance of an
absolute supremacy, it needs only be observed
to you, that one of these canons is, “That it
is not lawful for any man to dispute of the
pope’s power.” And to see how exactly our
kings were disposed to act upon it, one needs
only recollect that immortal apophthegm of the
elder <span class="smcap">James</span>, already taken notice of, “That it
is sedition for the subject to dispute what a
king may do in the height of his power.”</p>

<p>And as the canon laws are the pope’s laws,
so we are told, on the same supreme authority,
that the <i>English</i> laws are the king’s. For thus
on another occasion his majesty expresses himself.&mdash;“Although
a just prince” (I believe I
repeat his very words) “will not take the life
of any of his subjects without a clear law:
yet the same laws, whereby he taketh them,
are made by himself, or his predecessors;
and so the power flows always from himself.”&mdash;And
again, “Although a good king will
frame all his actions to be according to the
law, yet is he not bound thereto but of his
good will, and for good example giving to
his subjects<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>Thus decreed that <i>great school-master of the
whole land</i> (to give his majesty no harder a
title than he was pleased to give himself); and
it is difficult to say whence his supremacy extracted
this golden rule of <i>free monarchies</i>, if
not from the pope’s own code of imperial
canons.</p>

<p>Thus it appears what misconceptions arose,
and what strange conclusions were drawn, from
the king’s supremacy in spirituals. One might
proceed further in contemplation of this subject;
but I have wearied you too much already.
You will see from these several particulars how
it came to pass that the <span class="smcap">Reformation</span>, which
was founded on the principles of liberty and
supported by them, was yet for some time the
cause of strengthening the power of the crown.
For though the exercise of private judgment,
which was essential to Protestantism, could
not but tend to produce right notions of civil
liberty, as well as of religious faith and discipline,
and so in the end was fated to bring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
about a just form of free government (as after
some struggles and commotions, we see, it has
happened), yet the translation of supremacy
from the pope to the civil magistrate brought
with it a mighty accession of authority, which
had very sensible effects for several reigns afterwards.
The mysterious sacredness and almost
divinity which had lodged in the pope’s person,
was now inshrined in the king’s; and it is not
wonderful that the people should find their
imaginations strongly affected by this notion.
And with this general preparation, it followed
very naturally, that, in the several ways here
recounted, the crown should be disposed and
enabled to extend its prerogative, till another
change in the government was required to limit
and circumscribe it, almost as great as that of
the Reformation.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>I have listened with much pleasure to this
deduction which your lordship has made from
that important circumstance of the crown’s supremacy
in spirituals. I think it throws great
light on the subject under consideration, and
accounts in a clear manner for that appearance
of despotism which the <i>English</i> government
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
has worn from the times of reformation. I
have only one difficulty remaining with me:
but it is such an one as seems to bear hard on
the great hypothesis itself, so learnedly maintained
by my Lord Commissioner in our late
conversation, of the original free constitution
of the <i>English</i> government. For, allowing all
you say to be true, does not the very translation
of the pope’s supremacy to the king, considered
in itself, demonstrate that we had then,
at least, no free constitution at all, to be invaded
by the high claims of that prerogative?
If we admit the existence of any such, the supremacy
of the church should, naturally, I
think, have devolved upon the supreme civil
power; which with us, according to the present
supposition, is in the three estates of the
legislature. But this devolution, it seems, was
on the king alone; a public acknowledgment,
as I take it, that the constitution of the government
was at that time conceived to be, in the
highest sense of the word, absolutely <small>MONARCHICAL</small>.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>I was not, I confess, aware of this objection
to our theory, which is very specious. Yet it
may be sufficient, as I suppose, to reply to it,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
that the work of reformation was carried on
and established by the whole legislature; and
that the supremacy, in particular, though it of
right belonged to the three estates, was by free
consent surrendered and given up into the
hands of the king. It is certain this power,
though talked of as the ancient right of the
crown, was solemnly invested in it by act of
parliament.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>There may be something in this. Yet your
lordship, I think, does not carry the matter
quite far enough; and, with your leave, I will
presume to give another, and perhaps the truer,
answer to Mr. <span class="smcap">Somers’s</span> difficulty. The subject
is a little nice, but I have not those scruples
which may reasonably be conceived to restrain
your lordship from enlarging upon it.</p>

<p>I reply then directly, and without softening
matters, that this irregular translation of the
supremacy is no proof that there was not then
a <small>FREE CONSTITUTION</small>, with a legitimate power
in it, to which the supremacy belonged. And
my reason, without offence to my lord of <i>Salisbury</i>,
is this. When the papal authority was
abolished, and the question came into parliament,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
“who now became the head of the
church;” the search after him was not carried,
where it should have been, into the constitution
of the kingdom; but, as it was a matter
of religion, they mistook that, which was
only an affair of church discipline, to be a doctrine
of theology; and so searched, for a solution
of the question, in the New Testament,
and Ecclesiastical History. In the New Testament,
obedience is pressed to the person of
C&aelig;sar, because an absolute monarchy was the
only government in being: and, for the same
reason, when afterwards the empire became
Christian, the supremacy, as we know from
<i>ecclesiastical story</i>, was assumed by the emperor:
just as it would have been by the consul
and senate, had the republic existed. Hence
our Reformers, going altogether by spiritual
and ecclesiastical example, and hoping thereby
to preserve their credit against the reproaches
of <i>Rome</i>, which, as your lordship knows, was
perpetually charging them with novelties and
innovations in both respects, recurred to early
antiquity for that rule.</p>

<p>This attention to ecclesiastical example was,
I suppose, a consideration of convenience with
the wise fathers of our church: the other appeal
to the Gospel, might be a matter of conscience
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
with them. And thus by force of one
text, ill-understood, <i>render unto</i> <span class="smcap">C&aelig;sar</span> <i>the
things which are</i> <span class="smcap">C&aelig;sar’s</span>, they put the spiritual
sword into the king’s hands; just as by
another, <i>he beareth not the sword in vain</i> (for
I know of no better authority), the temporal
sword had also been committed to his care.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>This last intimation, I am apprehensive,
would bear a further debate<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>. But I acquiesce
in your answer to my particular question; I
mean, unless the bishop of <i>Salisbury</i> warns
me against submitting to so heretical a doctor.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>My Lord Commissioner chuses to let slip no
opportunity of exposing what he takes to be an
error in ecclesiastical management. Either
way, however, I am not displeased to find that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
his main thesis keeps its ground; and that,
even according to his own account of the matter,
the nation, when it gave up the supremacy
to the king, was in possession of a free and
legal constitution.</p>

<p>On the whole, you give me leave then to
presume that the considerations, now offered
to you, afford a reasonable account of that despotic
form under which the <i>English</i> government
has appeared, from the union of the two
roses down to the subversion of the constitution
in <span class="smcap">Charles</span> the First’s time.</p>

<p>Other causes concurred; but the Reformation
was the chief prop and pillar of the imperial
dignity, while the constitution itself remained
the same, or rather was continually
gaining strength even by the necessary operation
of those principles on which the Reformation
was founded. Religious liberty made way
for the entertainment of civil, in all its branches.
It could not be otherwise. It disposed the
minds of men to throw off that sluggishness,
in which they had slumbered for many ages.
A spirit of inquiry prevailed. Inveterate errors
were seen through; and prejudices of all sorts
fell off, in proportion to the growth of letters,
and the progress of reason.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p>The increasing trade and wealth of the nation
concurred with the temper of the times.
The circulation of property brought on a natural
relaxation of the feudal system. The plan
of liberty was extended and enlarged; and the
balance of power soon fell into the hands of
the people. This appeared very plainly from
the influence of parliaments, and the daring
attacks of many particular members on the
highest and most favoured claims of prerogative.
Our kings were sensible of the alteration:
but, instead of prudently giving way to it, they
flew into the opposite extreme, and provoked
the spirit of the times by the very reluctance
they shewed on all occasions to comply with
it. Every dormant privilege of the crown,
every phantom of prerogative, which had kept
the simpler ages in awe, was now very unseasonably
conjured up, to terrify all that durst
oppose themselves to encroaching royalty.
Lawyers and church-men were employed in
this service. And in their fierce endeavour to
uphold a tottering throne by false supports,
they entirely overthrew it. The nation was
out of all patience to hear the one decree the
empire of the kings of <i>England</i> to be absolute
and uncontrolable by human law: and the
other gave more offence, than they found credit,
by pretending that the right of kings to such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
empire was divine<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>. Every artifice indeed of
chicane and sophistry was called in to the support
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
of these maxims of law and theology. But
the season for religious and civil liberty to prevail
over the impotent attempts of each, was at
hand. The near approach of the <i>divine form</i>
created an enthusiasm, which nothing could
resist. It frustrated the generous views even
of her first and sincerest worshipers. In the
career of those ecstatic orgies, the unhappy
king could not prevent his ministers, first, and
afterwards the constitution itself, from falling a
victim to that fury, which, in the end, forced
off his own head.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p>Such was the issue of this desperate conflict
between prerogative and liberty. The wonder
was, that this fatal experience should not have
rectified all mistakes, and have settled the government
on a sure and lasting basis at the
Restoration. The people were convinced, that
nothing more was requisite to their happiness,
than the secure possession of their ancient legal
constitution. The re-called family were not so
wise. And in their attempts to revive those
old exploded claims, which had succeeded so
ill with their predecessors, they once more fell
from the throne, and left it to the possession
of that glorious prince whom the greatly-injured
nation has now called to it.</p>

<p>This then will be considered by grateful posterity
as the true &aelig;ra of <i>English</i> liberty. It
was interwoven indeed with the very principles
of the constitution. It was inclosed in the ancient
trunk of the feudal law, and was propagated
from it<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>. But its operation was weak
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
and partial in that state of its infancy. It acquired
fresh force and vigour with age, and has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
now at length extended its influence to every
part of the political system.</p>

<p>Henceforward, may we not indulge in the
expectation that both prince and people will be
too wise to violate this glorious constitution:
the only one in the records of time, which hath
ever attained to the perfection of civil government?
All the blessings of freedom which
can consist with kingly rule, the people have:
all the prerogatives of royalty, which can consist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
with civil freedom, are indulged to the
king. From this just intermixture of the popular
and regal forms, planted together in the
earliest days, but grown up at length to full
maturity, there arises a reasonable hope that
the <i>English</i> constitution will flourish to the
latest ages; and continue, through them all,
the boast and glory of our country, and the
envy and admiration of the rest of the world.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>How generous in your lordship is this patriot
augury of immortality to the <i>English</i> constitution!
Yet I dare not be so sanguine in my
expectations<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>. And Sir <span class="smcap">John Maynard</span>, I
suspect, who has seen the madness of kings
and people, in their turns, will hardly expect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
it from me. It may be sufficient that we put
up our ardent vows to Heaven, for the long
continuance of it. Less than this cannot be
dispensed with in an honest man. Every blessing
of civil policy is secured to us by this new
but constitutional settlement. And may our
happy country enjoy it, at least as long as they
have the sense to value, and the virtue to deserve
it!</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>When these fail, our wishes, and even
prayers themselves, will hardly preserve us.
Vice and folly, as you say, may do much towards
defeating the purposes of the best government.
What effect these may have, in time,
on the <i>English</i> liberty, I would not, for the
omen’s sake, undertake to say. You, my lord,
and Mr. <span class="smcap">Somers</span> (who are so much younger
men) may be able, hereafter, to conjecture
with more certainty of its duration. It is
enough for me that I have lived to see my
country in possession of it.

<span class="large">ON THE USES OF FOREIGN TRAVEL.</span><br />

<span class="medium">LORD SHAFTESBURY&mdash;MR. LOCKE;</span></h2>

<h3>TO ROBERT MOLESWORTH, ESQ.</h3>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">I&nbsp;could</span> not but be much surprised, my
dear friend, to receive your commands on a
subject, of which You, of all men, are the
greatest master. For who could so well advise
the party, you speak of, or resolve the general
question concerning <i>The Uses of Foreign Travel</i>,
considered as a part of modern breeding
and education, as <span class="smcap">He</span>, who has himself profited
so much by this practice, and, in a late
excellent treatise<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>, has given so convincing a
proof of its utility?</p>

<p>Besides, your application to me is a little
suspicious; and looks as if you wanted to draw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
from me a confirmation of your own sentiments,
rather than a candid examination of
them. For how was it possible for you not to
foresee the difficulty I must be under, in debating
this point with you? When have I
been able to dissent from you in any question
of morals or policy? and especially what chance
for my doing it in this instance, when you
know the bias which my own education, conducted
in this way, must have left upon me?</p>

<p>I am therefore at a loss, as I said, to account
for your fancy in making me of your council
on this occasion. But, whatever your purpose
might be, since you have thought fit to honour
me so far, I must own your Letter of Inquiry
could not possibly have found me in a fitter
season.</p>

<p>I happened just then to amuse myself with
recollecting a conversation, which, not many
days before, had passed between me and a certain
Philosopher of great note, on that very
subject.</p>

<p>You know the esteem I have of this Philosopher;
I mean, for such of his writings, as
are most popular, and deserve to be so; such
as his pieces on <i>Government</i>, <i>Trade</i>, <i>Liberty</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
and <i>Education</i>. No man understands the
world better; or reasons more clearly on those
subjects, in which that world takes itself to be
most of all, and is, in truth, very nearly concerned.</p>

<p>His Philosophy, properly so called, is not,
I doubt, of so good a taste; at least, his notion
of morals is too modern for my relish: I had
put myself to school to other masters, and had
learnt, you know, from his betters what to
think of <i>Life and Manners</i>; which they treat
in a style quite out of the way of these subverters
of ideal worlds<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>, and architects on material
principles<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>.</p>

<p>But on this head, my dear Sir, you have
heard me speak often, and may hear from me
more at large on some other occasion. With
exception to this one article (an important one,
however), no man is more able, than Mr.
<span class="smcap">Locke</span>, or more privileged by his long experience,
to give us Lectures on the good old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
chapter of <i>Education</i>; which many others indeed
have discussed; but none with so much
good sense and with so constant an eye to the
use and business of the world as this writer.</p>

<p>The purpose of your inquiry, then, cannot,
as I suppose, be any other way so well answered,
as by putting into your hands a faithful
account of his sentiments on the conduct
and use of <i>Travelling</i>: especially, as you will
perceive at the same time what my notions are
(if that be of any importance to you) on the
same subject.</p>

<p>If I were composing a Dialogue in the old
mimetical, or poetic form, I should tell you,
perhaps, the occasion that led us into this
track of conversation. Nay, I should tell you
what accident had brought us together; and
should even omit no circumstance of <i>time</i> or
<i>place</i>, which might be proper to let you into
the scene, and make you, as it were, one of us.</p>

<p>But these punctilios of decorum are thought
too constraining, and, as such, are wisely laid
aside, by the easy moderns. Nay the very
notion of Dialogue, such as it was in the politest
ages of antiquity, is so little comprehended
in our days, that I question much, if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
these papers were to fall into other hands than
your own, whether they would not appear in
a high degree fantastic and visionary. It would
never be imagined that a point of morals or
philosophy could be regularly treated in what
is called a <i>conversation-piece</i>; or that any
thing so unlike the commerce of our world
could have taken place between men, that had
any use or knowledge of it.</p>

<p>This, I say, might be the opinion of men of
better breeding; of those, who are acquainted
with the fashion, and are themselves practised
in the conversations, of the polite world. The
<i>formalists</i>, on the other hand, would be out
of patience, I can suppose, at this sceptical
manner of debate, which ends in nothing; and
after the waste of much breath, leaves the matter
at last undecided, and just as it was taken
up.</p>

<p>All this, it must be owned, is very true.
But as it is not my intention to submit the
following draught to such critics, you, who
know me, will accept this recital, made in my
own way, and pretty much as it passed. You
may well be trusted to make your own conclusions
from what is offered on either side of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
argument, and will need no officious monitor
to instruct you on which side the truth lies.</p>

<p>Not to detain you, by further preliminaries,
from the entertainment (such as it is) which I
have promised you; you may suppose, if you
please, Mr. <span class="smcap">Locke</span> and me, in company with
some other of our common friends, sitting together
in my library, and entering on the subject
in the following manner.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>And is not <small>TRAVELLING</small> then, in your opinion,
one of the best of those methods, which
can be taken to polish and form the manners
of our liberal youth, and to fit them for the
business and conversation of the world?</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>I think not. I see but little good, in proportion
to the time it takes up, that can be
drawn from it, under any management; but,
in the way in which it commonly is and must
be conducted, so long as <i>travel</i> is considered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
as a part of early education, I see nothing but
mischiefs spring from it.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>What! necessarily spring from it? And is
there no way to stop their growth; or at least
prevent their choking the good plants, which
that soil is capable of producing?</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>This indeed I must not absolutely affirm:
your Lordship’s example, I confess, stands in
my way. But if your own education, which
was conducted in this form, and creates a prejudice
for it, be pleaded against me, I may
still say, that the argument extends no further
than to qualify the assertion; and that, as in
other cases, the rule is general, though with
some exceptions.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>It was not my meaning to put your politeness
to this proof. I would even take no advantage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
of the exception which you might consent
to make in the case of many other travellers,
who have, doubtless, a better claim, than
myself, to this indulgence. What I would
gladly know of you, is, Whether, in general,
<i>Travel</i> be not an excellent school for our ingenuous
and noble youth; and whether it may
not, on the whole, deserve the countenance of
a philosopher, who understands the world, and
has himself been formed by it?</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Your Lordship, I think, will do well to put
<i>philosophy</i> out of the question. There is so
much to be said against <i>Travel</i> in that view,
that the matter would clearly be determined
against you. It is by other rules, and what
are called the <i>maxims of the world</i> (which
your Lordship understands too well, to join
them with philosophy), that the advocate for
travelling must demand to have his cause tried,
if he would hope to come off, in the dispute,
with any advantage.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>Yet philosophy was not always of this mind.
You know, when the best proficients in that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
science gave a countenance to this practice, by
their own example: a good part of their life
was spent in foreign countries; and they did
not presume to set up for masters of wisdom,
till experience and much insight into the manners
of men had qualified them for that great
office. Hence they became the ablest and
wisest men of the whole world; and their wisdom
was not in those days of the less account
for the politeness, that was mixed with it.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Those wise men might have their reasons for
this different practice. They most of them, I
think, set up for Politicians and Legislators, as
well as Philosophers; and in that infancy of
arts and commerce, when distant nations had
small intercourse with each other, it might be
of real advantage to them, at least it might
serve their reputation with the people, to spend
some years in voyages to such countries as were
in the highest fame for their wisdom or good
government.</p>

<p>Besides, the Sages of those times made a
wondrous mystery of their wisdom: a sure
sign, perhaps, that they were not over-stocked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
with it. It was confined to certain schools and
fraternities; or was locked up still more closely
in the breasts of particular persons. Knowledge
was not then diffused in books and general
conversation, as amongst us; but was to be
obtained by frequenting the academies or
houses of those privileged men, who, by a
thousand ambitious arts, had drawn to themselves
the applause and veneration of the rest
of the world.</p>

<p>All this might be said in favour of your
Lordship’s old Sages. Yet one of them, who
deserved that name the best, was no great Traveller.
I remember to have read, that <span class="smcap">Socrates</span>
had never stirred out of <i>Athens</i>; and
that, when his admirers would sometimes ask
him why he affected this singularity, he was
used to say, <i>That Stones and Trees did not
edify him</i>: intimating, I suppose, that the
sight of fine towns and fine countries, which
the voyagers of those days, as of ours, made a
matter of much vanity, was the principal fruit
they had reaped to themselves from their
fashionable labours.</p>

<p>However, allowing your lordship to make
the most of these respectable authorities for the
use of travelling, it must still be remembered,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
that they are wide of our present purpose.
They were <i>Sages</i>, that travelled: and we are
now inquiring, whether this be the way for
young men to <i>become</i> Sages. <span class="smcap">Plato</span> might
pick up more learning in his Voyages, than
any body since has been able to understand;
and yet a youth of eighteen be little the wiser
for staring away two or three years in mysterious
<i>Egypt</i>.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>Why, truly, if he carried nothing abroad
with him but the use of his eye-sight, I should
be much of your mind with regard to the improvements
he might be expected to bring back
with him. But let him hear and observe a
little, as well as see; and methinks a youth of
eighteen might pick up something of value,
though he should not return laden with the
mysteries of <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

<p>As to the gaiety on the ancient Sages, I
could be much entertained with it, if I did not
recollect that the more enlightened moderns
have, also, been of their mind in this instance.
To say nothing of other countries, which yet
have risen in reputation for knowledge and civility
in proportion to their acquaintance with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
neighbouring nations, surely it must be allowed
of our <i>own</i>, that all its valuable acquisitions
in both have been forwarded at least, if
not occasioned, by this reasonable practice.
We are now, without doubt, arrived at the
summit of politeness, and may subsist at length
upon our own proper stock. But was this always
the case? And must it not be acknowledged,
that the brightest periods of our story
are those, in which our noble youth were fashioned
in the school of foreign Travel? You
will hardly pretend that the ornaments of the
second <span class="smcap">Charles’</span> and <span class="smcap">Elizabeth’s</span> courts were
cast in the coarse mould of this <i>home-breeding</i>.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>I shall perhaps carry my pretensions still
further, and affirm it had been much better if
they had been so.</p>

<p>I know what is to be said for the voyagers in
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth’s</span> time. We were just then emerging
from ignorance and barbarity. Learning
and the Arts were but then getting up; and
were best acquired, we will say, in foreign
schools, and the commerce of other nations,
which might have the start of us in such improvements.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
The state of <i>Europe</i> at that
time was not unlike what I observed of the old
world, when knowledge was in few hands, and
the exclusive property, as it were, of particular
persons. So that it was to be travelled for, and
fetched home, by such as would have it. <i>Italy</i>,
in particular, was in those days, as it had long
been, the theatre of politeness, and without
doubt could furnish us with very much of the
learning we most wanted.</p>

<p>This then was the fashionable route of our
curious and courtly youth: and many accomplished
persons, I can readily admit, were to
be found in the number of our <i>Italian</i> Travellers.
Yet, methinks, they had done better to
stay at home, and at least import the arts of
<i>Italy</i>, if they were necessary to them, in sager
heads than their own.</p>

<p>I say this, because it is no secret that the
civility, we thus acquired, was dearly paid for;
and that irreligion, and even Atheism, were
packed up among their choicest gleanings, and
shewn about, at their return, as curiosities,
which could not but very much enhance the
consideration of those who had been to gather
them beyond the mountains<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>Or, shall we say, that this impiety of the
time was only employed to correct its superstition?
And that the philosophic spirits of
that age trafficked in these wares, as thinking
them a proper antidote to such as another set
of missionaries largely dealt in: I mean, the
<i>agnus Dei’s, holy beads, and consecrated medals</i>?</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Take it which way you will, the conclusion,
I believe, will scarcely be much in favour of
our <i>Italian</i> Travellers.&mdash;As to the worthies of
<span class="smcap">Charles’s</span> court, your Lordship, without doubt,
is disposed to divert yourself with them. For,
if they brought any thing with them from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
<i>France</i>, besides the dress of its follies and vices
(excepting always the sacred babble of their
language), it is a secret which it has not been
my fortune to be apprized of.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>And so, because Travelling may, by accident,
be attended with some ill effects, you
roundly determine against the thing itself; as
if the national improvement in arts and civility,
which unquestionably arose from it, were to
go for nothing!</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>I would have it go for no more than it is
honestly worth; which surely is something less
than the price paid for it, our principles and
our morals. And I doubt the truth is, that
this degeneracy in both was the usual acquisition
of our travelled youth, and the improvement,
your Lordship speaks of, only the accidental
benefit.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>Without doubt, there is no extending our
acquaintance with the world, but we run the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
risk of catching its vices, as well as virtues.
Yet, push this conclusion as far as it will go,
and you shut up mankind in absolute and incurable
barbarism. Such is the unhappy condition
of human nature, that in striving to cultivate
its powers, you furnish the opportunities,
at least, of its corruption. Yet to leave
it in that sordid state, for fear of those abuses,
is methinks but acting with the weak apprehension
of fond mothers; who deny their children
the liberty of stirring from the fire-side,
for fear of the dirt or damp air, which, in their
field-exercises, may chance to incommode
them.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>The allusion would be apt, if the health of
the mind, as of the body, depended on the use
of such liberty; or if it were true, that one
could as little help breathing the air of vice, as
that of the heavens. But, though I have heard
much of the dangers to which Virtue is exposed
in this bad world, I have never understood that
Vice is its proper element.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>Yet methinks, Sir, it will be hard to keep
clear of it in any part of the world, that I am
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
acquainted with: unless perhaps you take this
happy Island of ours to be as free from Vice,
as a Neighbouring one, they say, is from
Venom.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>There are, however, degrees in Vice, as
well as varieties of it; and I cannot think it
necessary for us to be greater proficients than
we are, or to import new species of it; by
rambling into countries where it may chance to
rage with greater virulence, or where such
modes of it, at least, prevail, as are luckily
unknown to us. And such, I doubt, were the
fruits of our <i>Italian</i> and <i>French</i> travels.</p>

<p>But allowing that Vice were of every clime,
the same every where, and equally malignant,
I should still imagine our youth to be safer from
the infection at home, under the eye and wing
of their own parents or families, than wandering
at large in foreign countries, with as little
care of others, as prudence of their own, to
guard them from this danger.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>Yes, if they were turned loose into this
wicked world, and left to their own devices.
But, what if some sage Philosopher&mdash;</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Some God, you would say, in the shape of a
Tutor; for a mere mortal Guide of that stamp
is not easily met with. Or, if He were, his
wisdom, I doubt, would hardly give him the
authority, he stands in need of, for the discharge
of his function. But I take your Lordship’s
raillery, and could say in my turn, But
what if some inquisitive and well-disposed
young Nobleman&mdash;</p>

<p>After all, we may let these two voyagers, so
well matched and fitted to each other, proceed
on their journey. The question at present is
of no such rarities; but of raw, ignorant, ungovernable
boys, on the one hand, and of shallow,
servile, and interested governors, on the
other. And if any good can arise from such
worthies as these, sauntering within the circle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
of the grand Tour, the magic of travelling can
<i>call up</i> more than I have ever yet seen.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>It may be true, perhaps, that the advantages
of travelling are not so great, or so general,
as is sometimes pretended. Yet, on the
other hand, that there are advantages, and
considerable ones too, can hardly be denied.
And to come at length more closely to the
point (for what has hitherto passed is but a
sort of prelude to the main argument) let me
have leave to state those advantages clearly and
distinctly to you, and then to request your own
proper sense (I mean as a man of the world,
according to the advice you just now gave me,
and not as a Philosopher) of this practice.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Is this fair dealing in your Lordship? I
supposed that by starting this question you
had meant only, as on other occasions, to engage
an old man in a little conversation;
whereas your purpose, I now find, is to make
a formal debate of it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>Not a formal debate, but a free conference;
for which we seem to have leisure enough;
and the subject is, besides, of real importance.
I may presume to answer for our friends here,
that they will not be displeased to assist at it.</p>

<p>I am aware, as you said, that the practice
may be sometimes inconvenient, as it is commonly
managed, on the side of <i>morals</i>; and I
would not be thought to have benefited so
little by yours, and the instructions of my
other masters, as not to lay the greatest stress
on that consideration.</p>

<p>But, after all, these inconveniences may be
pretty well avoided, by the choice of an honest
and able governor. Such an one it will
not be impossible to find, if the persons concerned
be in earnest to look out for him: I
do not say in <i>Cells</i>, for a Pedant without
manners; and still less, you will say, in
<i>Camps</i>, for a mannered man, without principles
or letters; but, in the world at large,
for some learned and well-accomplished person,
who, yet, may not disdain to be engaged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
in this noblest office of conducting a young
gentleman’s education.</p>

<p>Under such a Governor, as this, the danger,
to which a young man’s morals may be exposed
by early travel, will be tolerably guarded
against; and to make amends for the hazard
he runs in this respect, I see, on the other
hand, so many reasons for breeding young men
in this way, so many benefits arising from it at
all times, and such peculiar inducements with
regard to the present state of our own country,
that, I think, we shall hardly be of two minds,
when you have attended to them.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>We shall see that in due time. For the
present, the serious air, you assume, so different
from your wonted manner, secures my
attention.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>I cannot tell what may be the opinion of
others; but ignorance and barbarity seem to
me to be the parents of the most and the worst
vices. Conceit, pride, bigotry, insolence, ferocity,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
cruelty, are the native product of the
human mind, kept uncultivated. Self-love,
which makes so predominant a part in the
constitution of man, that some sufferers by its
excesses have mistaken it for the sole spring of
all his actions, naturally engenders these vices,
when no care is taken to controul its operations
by another principle.</p>

<p>On this account, wise men have had recourse
to various expedients; such as the provision
of Laws; the culture of Arts and Letters;
and, in general, all that discipline which
comes under the notion of early tutorage and
education. But none of these has been found
so effectual to the end in view, or is so immediately
directed to the purpose of enlarging the
mind, and curing it, at once, of all its obstinate
and malignant prejudices, as a knowledge
of the world acquired in the way of society,
and general conversation.</p>

<p>To say nothing of the solitary sequestered
life, which all men agree to term <i>Savage</i>, look
only on those smaller knots and fraternities of
men, which meet together in our provincial
towns and cities, and, without any larger
commerce, are confined within the narrow enclosure
of their own walls or districts. In as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
much as this condition is more social than the
other, it is, without doubt, more eligible.
Yet see how many weak views are entertained
by these separate clans, how many fond conceits,
and over-weening fancies! The world
seems to them shrunk up into their own private
circle; just as the heavens appear to children
to be contained within the limits of their
own horizon.</p>

<p>Extend this prospect of mankind to still
greater combinations, to states, kingdoms,
nations, and what we call a whole people. By
this freer intercourse, indeed, their thoughts
take a larger range, and their minds open to
more generous and manly conceptions. Yet
their native barbarism sticks close to them, and
requires to be loosened and worn off by a more
social habit, by the experience of a still wider
and more thorough communication. Tribes
of men, although very numerous, yet, if shut
up within one territory, and held closely together
under the influence of the same political
constitution, easily assimilate, as it were; run
into the same common sentiments and opinions;
and presently take, in the whole extent
of their community, one uniform prevailing
character.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p>Hence the necessity of their still looking beyond
their <i>own</i>, into other combinations and
societies; that so, as the mind strengthens by
this exercise, they may be enabled to shake
off their local, as we may say, and territorial
prejudices.</p>

<p>Those other societies may not be without
their defects, which it will be equally proper
to keep clear of. But, by this free prospect
of the differences subsisting between different
nations, each naturally gets quit of his own
peculiar and characteristic vices; and those of
others, presenting themselves to our unbiassed
observation, are not so readily entertained, or
do not cling so fast to us, as what have grown
up with us, and, by long unquestioned use,
are become, as we well express it, a <i>second
nature</i>.</p>

<p>Thus, by this near approach and attrition,
as it were, of each other, our rude parts give
way; our rough corners are insensibly worn
off; and we are polished by degrees into a general
and universal humanity.</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Externi</span> <i>nequid valeat per l&aelig;ve morari</i>,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>to use the poet’s words, though with some
small difference, I believe in their application.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<p>What says my friend to these principles?
are they just and reasonable? or, am I going to
build on precarious and insecure foundations?</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Whatever defect there may be in this foundation,
your Lordship, as a wise architect, is
for sparing no cost or pains in providing for its
stability. Yet, methinks, you go deeper for
it, than you need. At least, I did not expect
your defence of Travelling would require you
to make these profound researches into human
nature.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>I take your meaning. These researches,
you would say, are so little profound, that I
might have spared myself the trouble of making
them at all, at least in conversation with a
philosopher. Be that as it will; provided the
principles themselves, I am contending for, be
well founded. For the conclusion necessarily
follows, “That therefore <small>FOREIGN TRAVEL</small> is,
of all others, the most important and essential
part of Education.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>The youth of the most accomplished people
in <i>Europe</i> would have much to correct in
themselves, and something, perhaps, to learn,
in their voyages into the neighbouring nations;
however inferior to their own, in the general
state of knowledge and politeness. What then
must be the case of our <i>English</i> youth, confined
in this remote corner among themselves,
and indulged in their own rustic and licentious
habits?</p>

<p>Our country has never been famous for the
civility of its inhabitants. We have, rather,
been stigmatized in all ages, and are still considered
by the rest of <i>Europe</i>, as proud,
churlish, and unsocial. The very circumstance
of our Island-situation seems to expose us to
the just reproach of inhospitality. And if,
with this disadvantage, we should cherish, and
not correct, those vices which so naturally
spring from it, what less could we expect than
to be distinguished by such names, as our ill-manners
would well deserve, though our pride
might suffer from the application of them?</p>

<p>It seems then to be an inevitable consequence
of what has been said, that we of this
country have a more than ordinary occasion for
the benefits of <i>foreign travel</i>. And the reason
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
of the thing shews, they cannot be obtained
too soon. Young minds are the fittest to take
the ply of civility and good manners. The
task is less easy, and the success more uncertain,
when we enter upon this business late in
life; when intractable humours have gathered
strength, and the unsocial manner is become
habitual to us. Whatever may be objected to
the incapacity of this age in other respects,
youth is out of question the time for acquiring
right propensities and virtuous habits.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Your Lordship has so many good words at
command upon all occasions, that one cannot
but be entertained, at least, with your rhetoric,
if not convinced by it. But my present
concern is, to have a clear conception of your
argument, which in plain terms, as I apprehend
it, stands thus; “That every nation has
many vices and follies to correct in itself;
that this is perhaps more especially the case
of our own; and that early <i>Travel</i> is the
only, at least the most proper, cure for
them.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>That, Sir, is my meaning; and, though
expressed in more words than may be necessary,
it is surely not coloured by any rhetorical
exaggerations. But you must allow me to
proceed in my own way, and enforce the general
argument, I have delivered, by applying
it to the particular exigencies and necessities
of our <i>English</i> youth.</p>

<p>You, who have been abroad in the world,
and have so just a knowledge of other states
and countries, tell me, if there can be any
thing more ridiculous than the idiot <small>PREJUDICES</small>
of our home-bred gentlemen; which
shew themselves, whenever their own dear
Island comes, in any respect, to be the topic
of conversation. What wondrous conceits of
their own prowess, wisdom, nay of their manners
and politeness! With what disdain is a
foreigner mentioned by them, and with what
apparent signs of aversion is his very person
treated! They scarcely give you leave to suppose
that any virtuous quality can thrive out
of their own air, or that good sense can be expressed
in any foreign language. Nay, their
foolish prepossession extends to their very soil
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
and climate. Such warm patriots are they,
such furious lovers of their country, that they
will have it to be the theatre of all convenience,
delight, and beauty.</p>

<p>“To hear their discourse among themselves,
one would imagine that the finest lands near
the <i>Euphrates</i>, the Babylonian or Persian
<i>Paradises</i>, the rich plains of <i>Egypt</i>, the
Gr&aelig;cian <i>Tempe</i>, the Roman <i>Campania</i>,
<i>Lombardy</i>, <i>Provence</i>, the Spanish <i>Andalusia</i>,
or the most delicious tracts in the
Eastern or Western <i>Indies</i>, were contemptible
countries in respect of what they
dote upon under the name of <i>Old England</i><a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>.”</p>

<p>Now, if it were only for the sake of truth
and decency, if it were but to avoid the ridicule
to which these palpable absurdities and
childish fancies expose them, one cannot but
wish that our countrymen would open their
eyes, and extend their prospect beyond their
own foggy air, and dirty acres.</p>

<p>But this is the least inconvenience of their
home breeding. How many low <small>HABITS</small> and
sordid practices grow upon our youth of fortune,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
and even of quality, from the influence
of their family, or at best provincial, education!</p>

<p>They retain so much of their <i>Saxon</i> or <i>Norman</i>
character, that their noblest passion is
that of the Chace; unless a horse-race may,
haply, contend with it. Their ideas are all
taken from the stable or kennel; and they
have hardly words for any other sort of conversation.</p>

<p>In conjunction with this habit, or in direct
consequence of it, they plunge themselves into
the brutalities of the bottle and table. Having
little use of the faculty of thinking or discoursing
on any reasonable subject, they care
not how soon they disable themselves for either.
To this end, their surloins are of sovereign
effect; and if any spark of the <i>divine
particle</i> be still unsubdued, they quench it
forthwith in the strongest wines, or, which
suits their taste and design best, in their own
country liquor.</p>

<p>This sottish debauch leads to others. My
young master will be denied no animal gratification.
And thus low intrigues and vulgar
amours follow of course, in which the sum of
his refined pleasures is, at length, completed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>The rest of his life runs on in this drowzy
tenour; unless perhaps you except those intervals,
which can hardly be called <i>lucid</i>, when
his half-closed understanding seems stunned,
rather than awakened, by party-rage, election
bustle, and the noise of faction.</p>

<p>Admirable patriots these! and usefuller citizens
by far, than if they had acquired some
relish of temperance, decency, and reason, in
foreign courts, and the more improved societies
of <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p>But suppose our young gentleman to have
escaped this sordid taste, and by better luck
than ordinary to have finished his home education
without much injury to his morals.
Nay, suppose him to be inured, in good time,
to better discipline, and to have had the advantage
of what is called amongst us, by a violent
figure of speech, <i>a liberal education</i>.</p>

<p>To put the case at the best, suppose him to
have been well whipped through one of our
public schools, and to come full fraught, at
length, with <i>Latin</i> and <i>Greek</i>, from his college.
You see him, now, on the verge of the
world, and just ready to step into it. But,
good heavens, with what <small>PRINCIPLES</small> and <small>MANNERS</small>?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
His spirit broken by the servile awe of
pedants, and his body unfashioned by the genteeler
exercises! Timid at the same time, and
rude; illiberal and ungraceful! An absurd
compound of abject sentiments, and bigoted
notions, on the one hand; and of clownish,
coarse, ungainly demeanor, on the other! In
a word, both in mind and person, the furthest
in the world from any thing that is handsome,
gentlemanlike, or of use and acceptation in
good company!</p>

<p>Bring but one of these grown boys into a
circle of well-bred people, such as his rank
and fortune entitle him, and in a manner
oblige him, to live with: and see how forbidding
his air, how embarrassed all his looks
and motions! His awkward attempts at civility
would provoke laughter, if, again, his rustic
painful bashfulness did not excite one’s pity.
What wonder if the young man, under these
circumstances, is glad to shrink away, as soon
as possible, from so constraining a situation;
and to seek the low society of his inferiors, at
least of such as himself among his equals,
where he can be at ease, and give a loose to
his unformed and disorderly behaviour!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p>But now, on the other hand, let a young
gentleman, who has been trained abroad; who
has been accustomed to the sight and conversation
of men; who has learnt his exercises,
has some use of the languages, and has read
his <span class="smcap">Horace</span> or <span class="smcap">Homer</span> in good company; let
such an one, at his return, make his appearance
in the best societies; and see with what
ease and address he sustains his part in them!
how liberal his air and manner! how managed
and decorous his delivery of himself! In short,
how welcome to every body, and how prepared
to acquit himself in the ordinary commerce
of the world, and in conversation!</p>

<p>I should think, if there were no other advantage
of early travel, beside this of <i>manners</i>,
it were well worth setting against all the other
inconveniences, whatever they be, of this sort
of Education.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Good my Lord&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>I know what you would say: that <i>manners</i>,
in the proper acceptation of the word, at least in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
the sense of wise men, implies much more
than the ease, assurance, civility, (call it what
you will) which a young Traveller is supposed
to acquire in his intercourse with the politer
nations. Without doubt, it does. But give
me this foundation of good breeding to work
upon; and if I had the tutorage of a noble
youth, I durst be answerable for all the rest,
which even a philosopher includes in his sublime
notion of <i>manners</i>: whereas, without it,
his improvements of other sorts would be almost
thrown away; nay, his virtues themselves
would be offensive and unlovely.</p>

<p>But do not imagine I confine myself to <i>manners</i>
in the obvious meaning of that term. I
further understand by it an ability for ingenuous,
useful, and manly conversation. For
a traveller, that makes the proper use of his
opportunities, will be all of a piece, and return
as polished in his mind and understanding,
as in his person.</p>

<p>And here, again, how deficient is the turn
and course of our ordinary education! Whither
would you send our young pupil, to accomplish
himself in the necessary art of
speaking handsomely and thinking justly?
What companions have you provided for him,
or what instructors in this man-science will you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
direct him to? shall he court the acquaintance
of some lettered pedagogue in the schools, or
solicit the precious communication of some
famed professor in the occult sciences? Wonderful
models of correct wit, sublime sense,
and elegant expression!</p>

<p>I have read of an ancient Rhetorician, that
took upon him to teach others the <i>art of speaking</i>;
but in such a way, says my author, that
if a man had a mind to learn the art of <i>not
speaking</i>, he could not have been directed to
an abler master.</p>

<p>I forbear the application of my little tale,
out of pure respect to the modern disciples and
ornaments of this ancient school; and, without
pushing matters so far, it will be owned,
that whatever advantage of this sort may be
left at home, the loss will be amply made up
to an inquisitive traveller, on the Continent.
<i>France</i>, and even <i>Italy</i>, abounds in men of
distinguished literature and politeness. Nay,
a <i>German</i> Professor may supply the place of
an University Doctor. Think, what illustrious
persons may be sometimes met with even in a
<i>Dutch</i> town: and how many instructive hours
you and I have passed in conversation with
such knowing, candid, and accomplished scholars,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
as <span class="smcap">Le Clerc</span> and <span class="smcap">Limborch</span>. Philosophy,
and even Divinity, could take a liberal
air, under their management; and eloquence
itself might be learned, on almost every subject,
in their company.</p>

<p>I consider then the acquaintance and familiarity
of men of eminent parts and genius, as
another considerable benefit resulting from this
way of foreign education.</p>

<p>Still there are higher things in view (for,
now I have ventured thus far in the dogmatic
tone, I find myself, like our authorized teachers,
a little impatient of control, and in a humour
to run myself out without lett or interruption);
still, I say, there are higher advantages
in view from travelled culture and education.</p>

<p>You may think as slightly as you please, of
the exterior polish of <i>manners</i>, or may even
treat as superficial the <i>information</i> that can be
acquired in good company. But what say you
to that supreme accomplishment, a <small>KNOWLEDGE
OF THE WORLD</small>; a science so useful, as to supersede
or disgrace all the rest; and so profound,
as to merit all the honours, and to fill
up all the measures of the best philosophy?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
For, by <i>a knowledge of the world</i>, I mean
that which results from the observation of men
and things; from an acquaintance with the
customs and usages of other nations; from
some insight into their policies, government,
religion; in a word, from the study and contemplation
of men; as they present themselves
on the great stage of the world, in various
forms, and under different appearances. This
is that master-science, which a gentleman
should comprehend, and which our schools
and colleges never heard of.</p>

<p>I know this science is too difficult to be perfectly
acquired, but by long habit and mature
reflection. I know it is not to be expected
from a slight survey of mankind; from a
hasty passage through the different countries,
or a short residence in the great towns, of
<i>Europe</i>. All this I am not to be told; but
it must be allowed me at the same time, that
so important a study cannot be entered upon
too soon, and that the rudiments at least of
this science cannot be laid in too early.</p>

<p>The proper business of men, especially those
of rank and quality, lies among men. The
first and last object of a Gentleman should be
an intimate study and knowledge of his species.
Say, that some chapters of this great book, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
world, are above his reach, and too hard for
his decyphering. Yet others are easier and
more manageable. Initiate a young man betimes
in these pursuits; and his progress, as
in other things, must be the more sure and
successful.</p>

<p>Above all, let him be taught to give an early
attention to the manners of men, to observe
their dispositions, to inspect and analyze their
characters. What a field is here for an intelligent
young man, assisted by the superior lights
and experience of an able governor! And
what a harvest of true knowledge and learning
must he gather and bring home with him, from
the numberless varied scenes he has passed
through in his voyages! With what lustre
must such a person appear in the court or senate
of his own country! How secure against
the attempts of artifice and design! the plots
of insidious enemies, or the pretences of false
friends! how apt for the business of life, and
for bearing his part in public debates and cabinet-consultations!</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Your Lordship declaims so handsomely on
this theme, that I am something loth to spoil
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
your panegyric by asking a plain question,
“How this knowledge of the public affairs of
his own country is to be come at, by foreign
politics?”</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>As if the objects of that knowledge were not
every where much the same! Bigotry or Fanaticism
in religion, selfish or factious intrigues
in government, neglected or ill-improved agriculture
or commerce, insolence and want of
discipline in fleets and armies, a bad-constituted
police under venal magistrates, and a
corrupt administration; are not these the principal
mischiefs to be guarded against by our
young citizen, or perhaps senator? And where
is the country, which does not afford opportunities
of laying in useful lessons on all these
subjects?</p>

<p>To say the least, a little home-practice will
go a great way, when entered upon with so
true a preparation of general knowledge. On
the other hand, it hardly needs to be observed,
the disadvantage, with which our young Islander
must come into this scene; a novice to the
affairs of the world; a stranger to men and
characters; and who has never perhaps stretched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
his observation beyond the narrow circle of his
companions, or even his own family.</p>

<p>My panegyric, as you call this plain representation
of facts and things, would never have
an end, if I were to take to myself all the advantages,
which this topic of an early knowledge
of the world in a young traveller affords
me. But I leave the rest to be supplied out of
these hints; and pass on to other considerations,
which seem of moment to the credit and
reputation of our country, and to the accomplishment,
at least, of our ingenuous youth;
however they may rank in the estimation of
some, who in modern times have assumed to
themselves the name and office of Philosophers.</p>

<p>You, who have so much a nobler way of
thinking than these nominal sages, will allow
me, I hope, to lay some stress on the <small>LIBERAL
ARTS</small>; which adorn and embellish human life;
and, where they prevail to some degree of perfection,
are among the surest marks of the
civility and politeness of any people.</p>

<p>It is notorious enough how backward we
have been, and still are, in all these elegant
and muse-like applications. There is little or
nothing in the way of <i>picture</i>, <i>sculpture</i>, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
the arts of <i>design</i> among us, that can stand the
test of a knowing and judicious eye. It is but
of late we have begun to form to ourselves any
thing like an <i>ear</i> in harmony and the proportions
of just music. And whatever magisterial
airs our fashionable workmen in the dramatic
and poetical kinds may give themselves in their
prologues and prefaces, it is no secret to such
as have looked into the ancient masters, or have
made an acquaintance with the style and manner
of the politer moderns, that we are far
from possessing a right taste in these things,
and that the Muses have hitherto shewn themselves
but little indulgent to us.</p>

<p>The courtship, we have paid to them, has
been pressing and ardent, if you will; but this
circumstance, though it may do much, nay is
thought to do every thing with the sex, seems
not to have succeeded with these coy Ladies.
Passion and assiduity are not the only things:
somewhat of an address and management is
looked for in our advances. Wherever the defect
lies, and whatever be the cure for it, certain
it is, there is much of the Gothic manner in the
performances of our best artists: there is neither
chasteness of design, nor elegance of hand,
in our manual operations: nothing like correctness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
of thought, simplicity of style, or the
grace of numbers, in our literate productions.</p>

<p>’Tis true, the strength and vigour of our genius
has been exerted in other things. We
have been solicitous to procure a just taste in
policy and government, and have at length
succeeded in this first and highest emulation.
It may now be proper to apply the liberty, we
have so happily gained, to other improvements.
There is something, I have ever observed,
congenial to the liberal arts in the
reigning spirit of a free people. It must then
be our own fault, if our progress in every elegant
pursuit do not keep pace with our excellent
constitution.</p>

<p>But the likeliest way to quicken the growth
of these studies, is to turn our attention from
the bad models of our own country, and enter
into a free commerce and generous struggle,
as it were, with our more advanced neighbours.
And it is here again, as in the manners and
arts of life, the seeds of good taste cannot be
committed to the mind too soon. It were then
to be wished, that our young men had right
impressions of <i>art</i> in their tender years; and
that, forming their relish among the ablest
proficients in <i>Europe</i>, they might afterwards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
communicate their improvements to their own
country.</p>

<p>Thus, it might be hoped, in some convenient
time, we should have something of our
own to oppose to the wit, learning, and elegance
of <i>France</i>; and that, in the mechanic
execution of the fine arts, we should come at
length to vye with the <i>Italian</i> masters.</p>

<p>Nor think, that such an emulation as this
would be without its use, even in a moral and
political view. Beauty and virtue are nearer
of kin, than every one is perhaps aware of:
and the mind that is taken with the charm of
what is <i>true and becoming</i> in the representation
of sensible things, cannot be inattentive to
those qualities in the higher species and moral
forms. It is thither indeed the virtuoso passion
naturally tends; and there, it finally acquiesces.</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Quid <small>VERUM</small> atque <small>DECENS</small> curo et rogo, et omnis in hoc sum.</i><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But I see what you think of this language.
Let me add then, that policy, as well as philosophy,
is on the side of these studies. Who
can doubt their virtue in softening and refining
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
the manners of a people? or, to take policy in
its vulgar sense, where would be the hurt, if
<i>Britain</i> were the seat of arts and letters, as
well as of trade and liberty? Then might <i>we</i>
be travelled to, in our turn, as our neighbours
are at present: and our country, amidst its
other acquisitions, be also enriched (I use the
word in its proper, not metaphorical sense)
with a new species of commerce.</p>

<p>Not to insist, that the ascendant which one
nation takes over another in all public concerns,
is very much owing to this pre-eminence of
taste and politeness, to its acknowledged superiority,
I may say, in the literate and virtuoso
character; of which <i>France</i> is an instance
in our days; as <i>Italy</i> is well known to have
been in the days of our forefathers.</p>

<p>And, if there be use and value in such things,
how shall our ingenuous youth be tinctured
with a right sense of them, but by early and
well-conducted travel? For what discipline,
what examples, what encouragements, have
we at home? what academies for the genteel
exercises? what conferences for the improvement
of art or language? what societies for the
cultivation of the liberal character?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<p>The contemplation of these defects carries
me still further; to the source and fountain of
them all, which I make no scruple to lay open
to you.</p>

<p>“Time was, Sir, when philosophy herself
could appear with grace even in courts, when
the great and noble, nay and princes themselves,
were not ashamed to be of her train,
but frequented her studious schools and walks,
and were even ambitious of her company in
their hours of leisure and recreation.</p>

<p>See now to what unpractised cells and ignoble
societies she is degraded! her graceful form
faded and shrunk; her ingenuous sprightly air
deadened into I know not what gloom and austerity
of the cloyster.</p>

<p>You, who have done more than any other,
to retrieve her credit and bring her back to the
world, can best tell her present degenerate condition.
You know where she lies, unapproached
by her former suitors; her liberal
manner soured into disdain and hate; her persuasive
voice, which spoke the language of the
Gods, broken into untuned numbers and discordant
harshness; and her very sense corrupted
into empty sophisms and unintelligible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
jargon. The Graces, those companions of her
better days, are all fled: and in their room, a
riotous band of fauns and satyrs dance around
her. Yet still she assumes a sort of mock-sovereignty;
and, under the new name of <i>Genius
of the Schools</i>, presides, in sullen majesty,
over her numerous, servile, awe-struck votaries.”</p>

<p>In some such way as this, were I at liberty
to pursue the figured speech, and to adopt the
higher tone of the ancient masters, would I
presume to represent the present state of Erudition,
as we see it managed in certain sublime
seats and authorized nurseries amongst us.</p>

<p>And would you invite our liberal and noble
youth to resort thither? could you expect that
their free spirits would stoop to be lectured by
bearded boys; or that their minds could ever
be formed and tutored by such pedants, in a
way that fits them for the real practice of the
world and of mankind?</p>

<p>Have we not long enough submitted to the
inconveniencies of this monkish education?
Look on the generality of those persons who
have had their breeding in those seminaries.
What principles in morals, in government, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
religion, have sprouted thence! what dispositions
have we known corrupted by their discipline!
what understandings perverted by their
servile and false systems! Has truth, or liberty,
or reason, fair play from that quarter?
Nay, has not truth, and liberty, and reason,
though speaking by <small>ONE</small> of their own sons,
been calumniated and rejected! In a word,
have they not always set themselves to obstruct
the progress of true knowledge, and the cause
of freedom?</p>

<p>If such then be the state of our own seats of
literature and education, what more needs be
alleged in the behalf of <span class="smcap">Foreign Travel</span>;
which is the only means left to remedy these
mischiefs, or at least to palliate and correct
them?

<h2 id="DIALOGUE_VIII">DIALOGUE VIII.<br />

<span class="large">ON THE USES OF FOREIGN TRAVEL.</span><br />

<span class="medium">LORD SHAFTESBURY&mdash;MR. LOCKE.</span></h2>

<h3>TO ROBERT MOLESWORTH, ESQ.</h3>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Here</span> I concluded my defence: when Mr.
<span class="smcap">Locke</span>, perceiving, by the attention we all
paid to him, that we were now prepared to
receive his answer, raised himself in his chair,
and, with a firmer tone and look than I expected,
addressed himself to me in the following
manner.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Were the subject before us a matter of indifference
or curiosity, such as idle men are used
to discourse of, I could allow your lordship to
pursue it in this way of Socratic raillery and
declamation. But, if ever there was a question,
that deserved the examination of a philosopher,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
properly so called, it is, surely, this
of <span class="smcap">Education</span>; and, among the various parts
of it, none is more strictly to be inquired into,
as none is, perhaps, so big with important
consequences, as that which comes recommended
to us under the specious name of
<span class="smcap">Foreign Travel</span>.</p>

<p>I could not, therefore, but wonder to hear
your lordship enlarge so much, and so long,
on I know not what varnish of manners and
good breeding; of the knowledge of men and
the world; of arts, languages, and other trappings
and shewy appendages of education: just
as if an architect should entertain you with a
discourse on Festoons and Foliage, or the
finishing of his Frize and Capitals, when you
expected him to instruct you in what way
to erect a solid edifice on firm walls and
durable foundations.</p>

<p>What a reasonable man wants to know, is,
the proper method of building up <i>men</i>: whereas
your lordship seems solicitous for little more
than tricking out a set of fine <i>gentlemen</i>. It
seemed, indeed, as if your lordship had calculated
your defence of travelling for a knot of
Virtuosi, or a still more fashionable circle
(where, doubtless, it would pass with much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
ease and without contradiction); and had, somehow,
forgotten that your hearers are all plain
men; one of them, an old one; and he too, as
your Lordship loves to qualify him, a philosopher.</p>

<p>To speak my mind frankly, my Lord, your
defence of foreign travel, as lively and plausible
as it seemed, has no solid basis to rest upon.
You tell us of many defects in the breeding of
our <i>English</i> youth, and you would willingly
redress them: but in what way this is best
done, can never be known from vague and general
declamation.</p>

<p>To make this inquiry to purpose, some certain
principles must be laid down; some
scheme of life and manners must be formed;
some idea or model of the character, you would
imprint on young minds, must be described;
to which we may constantly refer, as we go
along; and by which, as a rule, we may estimate
the fitness and propriety of that sort of
breeding, you would recommend to us.</p>

<p>Since your Lordship then will needs have
me dictate to you on the subject of Education,
I must have leave to do it in another way, and
after a more solemn manner, than you perhaps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
expect from me in this freedom of conversation.</p>

<p>I begin with this certain principle: That
the business of education is to form the <span class="smcap">Understanding</span>,
and regulate the <span class="smcap">Heart</span>. If
man be a compound of Reason and Passion,
the only proper discipline of his nature is that
which accomplishes these two purposes.</p>

<p>So far we are, doubtless, agreed. But the
subject requires a more particular application
of this principle.</p>

<p>You have laboured with much plausibility
to persuade us, That the only reasonable education
is that which prepares and fits a man
for the commerce of the world: and I readily
admit the notion, provided we first agree about
the meaning of this big word, the <span class="smcap">World</span>.
Your Lordship, it may be, in your sublime
view of things, is projecting to make of your
Pupil, what is called, in the widest sense of
the term, a <i>Citizen of the World</i>. A great
and awful character, my Lord! But let us
advance by just degrees.</p>

<p>First, if you please, let us provide that he
be a worthy citizen of <i>England</i>; and, by your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
favour, let me ennoble this small island of ours
with the pompous appellation of the world. It
is that world, at least, in which our adventurer
is to play his part; and for the commerce of
which it concerns him most immediately to be
prepared.</p>

<p>Now, as your Lordship’s chief care is directed,
very properly, towards its chief subjects;
I mean, the men of rank and fortune,
whose ample property and noble birth give
their country the greatest concern in their education;
let me ask in what manner they are
likely to qualify themselves best for the important
parts, they are to act in it?</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>Certainly, by acquiring that knowledge,
and those accomplishments, that are most
proper for the discharge of them.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Undoubtedly, my Lord: there cannot be
two answers to so plain a question. As that
education is, in general, the best which forms
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
the man, in the best manner; so, in this confined
view, that education must be thought
the best, which forms the <i>Englishman</i>, in the
best manner.</p>

<p>To proceed then on this reasonable concession.</p>

<p>An <i>English</i> citizen, or, if you will, Senator,
(for this is the station to which our greater
citizens do, and our best should aspire) can
never acquit himself of the duties he owes his
country, under this character, but by furnishing
himself with all those qualities of the
<i>head</i> and <i>heart</i>, which his superior rank and
pretensions demand.</p>

<p>This <i>last</i> chapter is an important one; and
would be very long, if justice were done to it.
But a summary of the main articles, of which
it consists, may be given in few words.</p>

<p>I require then in our young aspirant to the
name and honours of an <i>English</i> Senator, that
his mind be early and thoroughly seasoned
with the principles of virtue and religion: that
he be trained, by a strict discipline, to the
command of his temper and passions: that his
ambition be awakened, or rather directed, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
its right object, the <i>public good</i>; and to that
end, that his soul be fired with the love of excellence
and true honour: above all, that he
have a reverence for the legal constitution of
his country, and a fervent affection for the
great community to which he belongs.</p>

<p>Your Lordship has a due respect for these
virtuous qualities of the <span class="smcap">Heart</span>, which will
give this consideration its full weight with you.
But were they of no more account, than many
institutors of youth seem disposed to reckon
them, still there are other qualities, those of
the <span class="smcap">Head</span>, in every man’s account essentially
requisite to the discharge of those offices,
which our greater citizens are destined to sustain.</p>

<p>I require, therefore, in the next place, that
our young Senator have a ready and familiar
use, at least, of the <i>Latin</i> tongue (your Lordship,
I know, will add, and of the <i>Greek</i>; but
in this I am not so peremptory): that he be
competently instructed in the elements of
science, as well as what are called polite letters:
that, especially, he be well grounded in
the principles of morals, public and private;
that he have made a thorough acquaintance
with the history of his own country, and with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
its constitution, Civil and Ecclesiastical: that
he have a general insight into the history of
the world, ancient and modern: above all,
that he have a well-exercised understanding;
I mean, that he be taught to reason clearly
and consequentially upon any subject: and,
further, to put all these abilities to use, that
he have a ready command of his own language,
and the power of expressing himself, whether
in writing or speaking, with ease and perspicuity,
at least, if not with elegance.</p>

<p>Other ornamental qualities I omit for the
present, which will almost come of themselves,
if his education be rightly conducted; or may
be acquired with little pains, and in the way
of diversion only. But these solid accomplishments
I hold it necessary for our youth of quality
to possess, by the time in which they
usually pass out of the hands of their Tutors
and Governors, I mean the age of twenty-one.</p>

<p>Am I unreasonable in these demands? or
can any thing less be dispensed with in a gentleman,
who, by established custom, is to enter
into the world at those years, and to bear
a part in the public business and legislature of
his country?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>Without doubt, these accomplishments are
no more than may be reasonably required in
our young gentleman, or Senator. But how
they are to be come at in our vulgar way of
<i>Education</i>, I do not easily apprehend.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Of that, in due time. At present, you accept
this as a reasonable idea or sketch of an
<i>English</i> gentleman’s character; such as the
course of his education ought to imprint upon
him: and I shall now shew you very clearly
that it is not possible to be attained in the way
of <i>foreign Travel</i>.</p>

<p>Consider, <i>first</i> of all, the unavoidable <small>WASTE
OF TIME</small>; of that time which is so precious in
every view; not only as being the most proper
for making the acquisitions, I speak of;
but as being the only period of his life, which
he will be at liberty to employ in that manner.</p>

<p>Early youth is flexible and docile: apt to
take the impressions of virtue, and ready to
admit the principles of knowledge. The faculties
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
of the mind are then vigorous and alert:
the conception quick, and the memory retentive.
The humble drudgery of acquiring the
elements of literature and science is to young
minds an easy and a flattering employment.
A submissive reverence for their teachers disposes
them to proceed without reluctance in
any path that is prescribed to them; and a
springing emulation, joined to a conscious
sense of gradual improvement, gives force and
constancy to their pursuits. The objects of
their application seem important; not only
from the novelty of them, and the authority
of those who have the direction of their studies,
but chiefly perhaps from a confused sense of
their value, much above what they would entertain,
were they able to form a true and distinct
judgment of them.</p>

<p>This, then, is the season for laying the
foundations of knowledge and ability of every
kind; and if you let it slip, without applying
it carefully to those purposes, you will in vain
lament the omission in riper years, when the
cares or amusements of life afford little leisure
for such pursuits, and less inclination.</p>

<p>There may have been some few examples of
those, whose superior industry in advanced age
has atoned for the defects of their education.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
But in general the <i>man</i> depends intirely on the
<i>boy</i>; and he is all his life long, what the impressions,
he received in his early years, have
made him<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>. If therefore any considerable part
of this precious season be <i>wasted</i> in foreign
travel, I mean if it be actually <i>not employed</i>
in the pursuits proper to it, this circumstance
must needs be considered as an objection of
great weight to that sort of education.</p>

<p>Your Lordship may consider, <i>next</i>, the
<small>DISSIPATION OF MIND</small> attending on this itinerant
education; while the scene is constantly
changing; and new objects perpetually springing
up before him, to solicit the admiration of
our young traveller.</p>

<p>One of the greatest secrets in education is,
to fix the attention of youth: a painful operation!
which requires long use and a steady unremitting
discipline; the very reverse of that
roving, desultory habit, which is inseparable
from the sort of life you would recommend.
The young mind is naturally impatient of constraint:
it hates to be confined for any time in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
the same track; and is flying out, at every
turn, from the proper subject of its meditation.
Instead of counteracting this native infirmity,
you indulge and flatter it; till, by degrees, the
mind loses its tone and vigour, and is utterly
incapable of paying a due attention to any
thing.</p>

<p>I insist the more on this consideration, because
in acquiring the elements of learning it
is of great importance that the learner proceed
uniformly in the course on which he has entered.
It may now and then be the privilege of a
genius, to seize the principles of knowledge at
once, and to grow wise, as we may say, by
intuition. But the common sort of minds are
of another make. It is by slow steps only that
they arrive at knowledge; and, if you stop or
divert their progress, their labour is all thrown
away, or yields at best a shallow, superficial,
and ill-digested learning.</p>

<p>But were no account to be had of <i>the loss of
time</i>, or of <i>this dissipated turn of mind</i>, which
is still more pernicious, I should nevertheless
object to this travelled education, on account
of the very objects to which our traveller’s
<small>APPLICATION</small> is directed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<p>Instead of those necessary and fundamental
parts of knowledge, which I require him to
have laid in, his attention, so much of it as
can be spared for any thing that looks like information,
is wasted on things either frivolous
or unimportant.</p>

<p>His <i>first</i> business is, to make himself perfect
in the forms of breeding, which he finds
in use among those he lives with, or perhaps
in their forms of dress only.</p>

<p>His <i>next</i> concern is, to acquire a readiness
in the languages of <i>Europe</i>; or, to shorten his
labour as much as possible, at least in the
<i>French</i> language. The pretence is, that he
may fit himself for conversation with his foreign
acquaintance; which takes up much time
to little purpose, as the use ceases, in a good
degree, with his return home: and, that he
may qualify himself for perusing their best
books; which takes him off from the study of
those which are still better; in the learned
languages, and I will venture to say, in his
own.</p>

<p>If any thing <i>further</i> employ his attention,
it is perhaps a little virtuosoship. He inquires
after fine pictures, fine statues, fine buildings.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
He visits the shops of artificers; gets admission
to libraries, cabinets of medals, and repositories
of curiosities; and, for some relaxation
from these arduous toils, is frequent at
Churches, Theatres, and Courts of Judicature,
and stares at processions, ceremonies, and other
solemn shews.</p>

<p>And, now, when these three points have
been duly attended to, I leave your Lordship
to guess what leisure he is likely to have for
accomplishing himself in those other studies,
which you allow me to suppose are of much
greater importance.</p>

<p>In one word, my Lord, if he acquires any
knowledge, it is only, or chiefly, of such
things as he may very well do without, or, at
best, are of an inferior and subordinate consideration:
while the branches of learning, he
must neglect for these, are of the most constant
use and necessity to him in the commerce of
his whole life.</p>

<p>Till then your Lordship can find a way to
reconcile these different pursuits, I must be of
opinion that the boasted way of travel is the
worst that can be contrived for the proper instruction
of our young countrymen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>Without doubt, if these less important points
engross all their attention. But can there be
a difficulty in carrying on the two designs together;
especially, if a good and attentive tutor
be at hand to direct his pupil’s pursuit and
quicken his application?</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Your Lordship, like the friends and parents
of a young traveller, is for exacting wonders at
the hands of this important personage, a tutor.
But the truth is, so many, and so different
things cannot be well learned, even with the
advantage of the best parts under the very best
direction.</p>

<p>Besides, your Lordship forgets that what we
now inquire into, is, whether the generality of
our <i>English</i> youth of quality should be educated
in this form; not, whether two or three
young men, of the most uncommon genius
and application, may not possibly succeed in
it. I demand an education, which may ordinarily
produce useful and able men: your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
Lordship is providing only for, what comes of
itself, a prodigy.</p>

<p>And now, my Lord, with this preparation,
I think myself enabled to reply distinctly to
the several arguments you alleged for the expediency
of foreign travel. It is very clear,
that the most solid advantages are lost by it.
But perhaps we shall find a recompense for
this loss, in the shewy and ornamental accomplishments,
which travel promises; and which
your Lordship supposes the world will readily,
and with reason, accept instead of them.</p>

<p>These accomplishments are summed up in
the <small>BENEFITS</small> of an enlarged society and conversation;
which, again, branch out into many
heads; and under different names, furnished,
I think, the substance, as well as governed the
method, of your vindication.</p>

<p>This was the polite and popular theme,
which you chose to dress out in all the colours
of your eloquence. To make way for these,
and to lay them on with more effect, your
Lordship was pleased to tell us a very melancholy
story. <i>England</i>, it seems, is over-run
with barbarism and ignorance; its inhabitants
are rude and uncivilized; and nothing can be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
learnt among them, which is fit to appear in
good company.</p>

<p>If this had been said of our forefathers in
<span class="smcap">C&aelig;sar’s</span> time, or even in good King <span class="smcap">Edgar’s</span>,
when the land, they say, was over-run with
wolves (by which, I suppose, the monkish
mythology means <i>men</i>, as savage); I could
have found but little, it may be, to oppose to
the accusation. But at this time of the day,
when arts and letters have at least made some
progress among us; when commerce has extended
our acquaintance with the rudest parts
of the globe, and policy strengthened our connexions
with the most civilized; when our
country is filled with large flourishing towns,
and even prides itself in a vast, opulent, and
splendid metropolis; I could not but think the
charge was a little aggravated, or that your
Lordship had forgotten to speak of <i>England</i>,
as it now subsists, in the close of the seventeenth
century. It seemed to me as if the
<i>English</i> might now, at least, deserve to be
considered as <i>men</i>; and that in our courts and
camps, if not in our colleges, we might stand
a chance of finding what your Lordship would
not disdain to qualify with the name of <i>gentlemen</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>But the other representation was more favourable
to your Lordship’s cause: and out of
that representation arose the several <span class="smcap">Barbarities</span>,
with which you thought fit to mortify
and alarm us.</p>

<p>The first fire of your zeal is spent on that
swarm of <span class="smcap">Prejudices</span>, with which our <i>English</i>,
or at least provincial, youth are commonly
over-run.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prejudices</span>, my Lord, is an equivocal term;
and may as well mean right opinions taken
upon trust, and deeply rooted in the mind, as
false and absurd opinions, so derived and grown
into it.</p>

<p>The <i>former</i> of these will do no hurt; on the
contrary, perhaps, the very best part of education
is employed in the culture of them.</p>

<p>But admit, they are of the <i>latter</i> sort: still
they may be only the excesses of right principles
and notions. And in that case, I should
doubt whether the evil be of consequence
enough to deserve your indignation. Perhaps
no man has enough of certain virtues, that
does not carry them something too far. The
just degree, the precise mean, is a nice point
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
to hit. The condition of our common nature
is such, that we either overshoot the mark, or
fall short of it; and your Lordship easily apprehends
which is the more convenient as well
as more generous part, in this moral archery.</p>

<p>Besides, reflexion and experience will come
in, soon enough to moderate these excesses.
So that, for my part, though our young patriot
should happen to entertain the extravagant conceit,
you diverted yourself with, of the soil and
climate of <i>Old England</i>, I should take that
for no great objection to his home-breeding,
and should, possibly, not be over-forward to
disabuse him of such honest errors.</p>

<p>Surely, my Lord, there are certain <i>associations</i>
of ideas, which, however oddly formed,
your Lordship would be something loth to
undo.</p>

<p>To take your own instance: What if the
ideas of liberty chanced to be closely connected
with those of <i>Old England</i>; so as, by the
magic of this union, to convert her rude heaths
and barren mountains into pleasurable landskips;
would you be forward, if you had it in
your power, to dissolve this charm, and, by
setting those objects in their true and proper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
light, disenchant the mind, at the same time,
from the idea, or warm love at least, of <i>English</i>
liberty?</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>You know well, I perceive, how to chuse
your instances. The force of this, you suppose,
will hardly be lost on him, who professes
himself an adorer of that liberty. But, under
favour, I see no such inconvenience, as you
suggest, in putting asunder two things which
truth and nature had no hand in bringing together.
<span class="smcap">Liberty</span> has charms enough to attach
the mind, wherever the place of her abode be;
and I have never heard that the loveliness of
her form is impaired, or even disgraced, by the
homeliness of her habitation.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>It may be so; and the reason, as in the case
of the more selfish affections, is, That the habitation
of our idol, whatever be our worship,
is rarely thought homely. But convince us
that our country is scarce worth contending for,
and, as lovely as its Goddess Liberty may appear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
to enamoured eyes, the generality of her
votaries will, I doubt, be something slack in
her defence.</p>

<p>But, after all, an illustration must not be
questioned at this rate. It is enough, that your
Lordship sees I am not for discarding Principles,
under the opprobrious name of Prejudices.
The tender minds of youth are to be
treated with indulgence. If they put forth too
fast, and too luxuriantly, let the ordinary methods
of culture be applied to them. A little
dressing and pruning, at fit seasons, may do
more good, than <i>transplanting</i>: a fatal experiment,
in many cases; which, in checking
the immoderate vigour of its growth, kills the
tree, or, at best, brings on a languishing and
dwarfish imbecillity.</p>

<p>If, indeed, by Prejudices you mean <i>vicious
principles</i>, properly so called; that is, vicious
in themselves, as well as in the degree: these,
it is certain, must be rooted up; and the
sooner, the better: but then there is no need
of crossing the seas for the benefit of such an
operation.</p>

<p>For the proper cure of such prejudices, as I
take it, is to be made by the application of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
those truths that are common to all climes;
not by the partial manners or opinions which
arise out of them in this or that more polished
society.</p>

<p>But your Lordship, I observed, as though
you had taken up this charge of Prejudices
purely to introduce the satire on <i>Old England</i>,
was content to drop it, as soon as it had served
your turn. You exchanged it, however, for
<i>another</i> of more importance, <small>THE LOW, SORDID,
AND IMMORAL HABITS</small>; which strike into the
lives and manners of our youth, and are, as
you conceive, epidemical and incurable in this
Island.</p>

<p>It may be true, that too much of the complaint
is well-founded. The taste of our provincial
gentry may be something coarse; and their
houses, none of the best schools of civility and
politeness: so that low and even immoral
habits may be, and, I doubt, too often are,
the fruit of an ordinary domestic education.
But then what remedy does your Lordship prescribe
for the removal of them? Why, you
send them abroad with all their imperfections
upon their heads; to get rid of their bad habits,
as they can, and to pick up better, as they
will: or, do you perhaps imagine that the ill
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
qualities, they take out with them, will drop off,
of themselves? and that the good ones they
stand in need of, like new leaves in the spring,
will immediately put forth and take their places?</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>I do but imagine, that bad habits are only
to be expelled by better; and that therefore
the readiest way for our countrymen to get
quit of their ill manners, is, to force them into
good company. And, with your leave, I see
nothing very absurd or unreasonable in this
imagination.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Certainly not, in prescribing good habits as
a cure for bad ones. But your Lordship had
done well to shew what there is in a foreign
air, that is so propitious to good habits, as that
none but such can thrive in it; or, if there be
a mixture of good and bad, as with us, how
your traveller shall be secured against an ill
choice. Otherwise our young spark may pick
up new habits indeed; but they may only be
different from what he took from home, not
better or more reasonable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<p>I doubt, my Lord, that, when such rude
and untutored boys find themselves removed
from that restraint which the eye of a parent,
though but little accustomed to civility himself,
imposed upon them, they will rather give way
to a freer indulgence of their own froward humours,
than be in any disposition to check and
reform them. What inclination will such
persons have to benefit by good company? or
how indeed will they gain admittance into it?</p>

<p>I appeal to your own observation, whether,
when this sort of ill-educated people get
abroad, and settle for a time in some frequented
city, their usual way be not to keep at distance
from the better company of the place, and to
flock together into little knots and clubs of
their own countrymen, or of such others as are
most resembling in taste and manners to themselves;
where all their low humours are freely
indulged, and even inflamed, by the mutual
society and countenance of one another. This,
your Lordship knows, is most frequently the
case; while the obsequious tutor is at length
more likely to be swayed by the importunity,
and perverted by the ill example, of his disciples,
than they are to be restrained by his advice
and authority.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

<p>But, though foreign travel should be indeed
a remedy for the mischiefs, complained of, I
still question whether it would be a <i>proper</i> one.
Suppose our young gentleman to be of so pliant
a make, as to lay aside his rustic and illiberal
habits in complaisance to the better company,
he is obliged to live with: does it immediately
follow, that he will adopt none but what are
fit for him to assume; and, with so raw and
undiscerning a judgment as he carried out with
him, that he will have the skill to select only
and assume such manners as are most becoming
and ornamental?</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>As if one needs be in any pain, on that head;
when the habits, I spoke of, are not only different
from those he must assume abroad, but
the very reverse of them!</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Alas, your Lordship is not to be told, that
the reverse of wrong is not always right. Even
in the instance your Lordship puts, a young
man may be polished indeed out of his rusticity;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
yet, if he have no better rule to go by,
than the fashion of the place where he lives, he
may easily wear himself into the contrary defect,
an effeminate and unmanly foppery. And,
for the probability of such miscarriage, your
Lordship is again referred to your own experience
and observation.</p>

<p>As to what I take to be the proper remedy
for these barbarities, that is another question,
which I may afterwards find occasion to explain
to you more at large. For the present, I
must take leave to conclude, that, under the
circumstances here supposed, foreign travel is
generally an <i>insufficient</i>, always an <i>improper</i>,
cure for them.</p>

<p>Your Lordship indeed goes further. You
contend, that, if these sordid and dirty habits
could by any means be expelled, still our <i>English</i>
education is so essentially bad, that no
liberal or graceful manners could be derived
from it. And here your Lordship’s rhetoric
expatiates in full security. You seem confident
that, though a method might be found
out for making reasonable men, yet our home-breeding
is absolutely incapable of furnishing
fine gentlemen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

<p>On this occasion it was, that the servile discipline
of our schools, and the pedant tutorage
of our colleges, afforded ample scope to your
resentment. From an over-charged picture of
both these, your Lordship finds means to dress
up such a prodigy of ill manners, as must be
the scorn, or pity, of all good company:
which, to move our pity, or our scorn the
more, your Lordship, I remember, took care
to contrast to the easy, the assured, the all-sufficient
air of a finished traveller.</p>

<p>To this triumphant part of your harangue,
I have only to oppose some plain and simple
truths.</p>

<p>The awkward bashfulness of a young man is
a sin which, I know, admits of no expiation,
in good company. However, what good company
will not pardon, it will soon remove.
And, till that blessed time comes, let it <i>first</i>
be considered that the modesty of ingenuous
youth, though a terrible vice in itself, is yet
favourable to some virtues. It is full of deference
and respect; it preserves innocence;
nourishes emulation; and, till reason be of
age to take the rein into her hands, suspends
and controuls all the passions. Nay, if it did
nothing more than dispose a young man to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
observe much and talk little; even this advantage
might be some recompence for the ill
figure it gives him in the eyes of your Lordship’s
good company.</p>

<p>Have a care, my Lord, lest by taking off
this restraint too soon, you emancipate your
favoured youth from every principle of honour,
and let him run headlong into worthlessness,
dissolution, and ruin!</p>

<p>I know what the world is ready to think of
this talk. But a truce with the world. I am
a Philosopher, your Lordship knows: nay,
your Lordship, too, is a Philosopher. Let
us for once then hazard an unfashionable
truth, that modesty in a young man is his
grace and ornament; and that a confident
young booby, not a bashful one, is the prodigy
that needs the expiation.</p>

<p>Consider, <i>further</i>, my Lord, that bashfulness
is not so much the effect of an ill education,
as the proper gift and provision of wise
nature. Every stage of life has its own set of
manners, that is suited to it, and best becomes
it. Each is beautiful in its season; and you
might as well quarrel with the child’s rattle,
and advance him directly to the boy’s top and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
span-farthing, as expect from diffident youth
the manly confidence of riper age.</p>

<p>Lamentable in the mean time, I am sensible,
is the condition of my good Lady; who,
especially if she be a mighty well-bred one, is
perfectly shocked at the boy’s awkwardness,
and calls out on the taylor, the dancing-master,
the player, the travelled tutor, any body
and every body, to relieve her from the pain of
so disgraceful an object.</p>

<p>She should however be told, if a proper season
and words soft enough could be found to
convey the information, that the odious thing,
which disturbs her so much, is one of nature’s
signatures impressed on that age; that bashfulness
is but the passage from one season of
life to another; and that as the body is then
the least graceful, when the limbs are making
their last efforts and hastening to their just
proportion, so the manners are the least easy
and disengaged, when the mind, conscious and
impatient of its imperfections, is stretching all
its faculties to their full growth.</p>

<p>If I had the honour of her Ladyship’s ear,
I might further add, for her comfort, that as
to this over-whelming modesty, which muffles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
merit, the boy, if she have but patience, will
presently outgrow it, as he does his cloaths;
that when this cloak of shame has done its
work of warming and invigorating his young
virtue, it may safely be laid aside, or rather
will drop off of itself; and that, as poor and
sheepish a thing as master now is, he may turn
out, in the end, as forward a spark as the best
of them.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>Fye, Mr. <span class="smcap">Locke</span>; what, my philosopher
give into this gaiety! he, who reproached me
just now for the way of raillery and declamation!</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Your Lordship does well to upbraid me for
treating in so light a manner what deserves,
indeed, the most indignant reproof. For,
what is this endeavour to quench ingenuous
shame, but a blasphemous attempt to counteract
the designs of Providence, and obliterate,
by main force, one of the most natural, as
well as most precious, distinctions of early
youth? Modesty is the blush of budding reason
and virtue: and if art could succeed in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
preposterous project of forcing the fruit without
the bud, not only this prime grace of the
year would be lost, but the production itself,
though it might be wondered at as a rarity,
could never pretend to the flavour and ripeness
of that which is of nature’s own growth.</p>

<p>In plain words, my Lord, modesty is the
ornament of youth: and the earnest or rather
the proper cause, of all that is excellent in riper
age. It graces the boy, and, in due time,
forms the man: whereas in suppressing this
young virtue, you precipitate, indeed, a sort
of manhood; which, yet, in effect, is only a
perpetual boyism, or rather a portentous mixture
of both states, without the virtues of
either.</p>

<p>I am far from meaning by all this, and your
Lordship will be as far from suspecting me to
mean, that an easy unconstrained manner is
not an amiable and agreeable thing. I am
only for waiting the proper time of its appearance;
which nature makes a little later than
our impatient fancies are ready to prescribe to
her.</p>

<p>Consider too this polite accomplishment,
this supreme finishing of a well-formed character,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
can only be acquired, except in some
extraordinary instances, by long incessant use
and habit in conversation; which, besides the
unfitness of the thing in other respects, would
dissipate the young mind too much, and take
it off from those other more important pursuits,
which are proper to that age.</p>

<p>Nay, I might further say, and with much
truth, that politeness, in your Lordship’s, at
least the court-sense of the word, is not to be
attained by the ablest men; and when it is attainable,
would generally do hurt, I mean beyond
a certain degree, to its possessors.</p>

<p>No very great man was ever what the world
calls, perfectly polite. Men of that stamp
cannot afford such attention to little things, as
is necessary to form and complete that character.</p>

<p>And even to men of a common make, that
excessive sedulity about grace and manner,
which constitutes the essence of good-breeding,
would be injurious; as it tends to cramp their
faculties, effeminate the temper, and break
that force and vigour of mind which is requisite
in a man of business for the discharge of
his duty, in this free country.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

<p>So that, for any thing I see, this exquisite
ease of good breeding should be left to the
ambition of still inferior spirits, of such indeed
as are conscious to themselves of an incapacity
for any other.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>The concession is gracious; and the danger,
no doubt, alarming, lest our senators and men
of business should be disabled for their high
functions by an excess of good manners. Yet
’tis some consolation, that at present I see no
symptoms of that enfeebling politeness among
such of the ornaments of either house, as I
have the honour to be acquainted with.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Your Lordship may divert yourself as you
think fit, with an old man’s fears. But if this
mode of travelling, which has taken so much
with us since the peace<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>, should continue for
any time, the day may come but too soon,
when these fancies of mine will be realized:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
when politeness shall be fatal to ability of
every kind; and, at least in the higher ranks
of life, when our countrymen shall be too well
bred to be good for any thing.</p>

<p>And now, having ventured so far, shall I
proceed one step further, and take to myself
the privilege of an old man, to express my
sense of this whole matter, a little unfashionably?
The mighty value, that is set upon
manners, comes, as I have already hinted,
from a quarter, which, though it may imprint
respect on a person of your Lordship’s age and
gallantry, must not pretend to be so much
considered by grey hairs. If you can forgive
the liberty, I will then, at length, speak out,
and say, They are the ladies, only, or chiefly,
that have affixed such an idea of merit to this
envied quality of good-breeding; and that, as
appearances are thought to sway full enough
with that delicate sex, they may perhaps have
advanced the credit of it something higher than
such an accomplishment deserves.</p>

<p>And when I further consider the mighty influence
which these fair dispensers of reputation
must needs have on our gallant and courtly
youth, I cannot wonder that the mode of foreign
travel is become so fashionable. Nay, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
am half inclined to suppose, that, in this debate
between us, I have rather your politeness
to contend with, than your judgment: and
that, if your Lordship would deal roundly
with me, your answer on this occasion would
be the same with <small>HIS</small>, who, (as I have heard
you tell the story) being questioned by his
friends why a person of his acknowledged sense
and bravery would accept the challenge of a
coxcomb, thought it vindication enough of
himself to reply, “that, for the <i>men</i>, he could
safely trust their judgment; but how should
he appear, at night, before the <i>maids of
honour</i><a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>?”</p>

<p>Whether I presume too much in this fancy,
is not material. It is enough to say, that
what there is of use or beauty in polite carriage
will come of itself, with a little experience of
the world and good company; and shall not,
with my consent, be purchased at the expence
of far better things.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>Nor with mine: for, with all the courtliness
and gallantry you make me master of, I never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
intended by the <i>good company</i>, I mentioned
with so much respect, either those foolish
men, or women, who prefer the forward assurance
of their boys to every other consideration.
I only think that a reasonable attention
to the manners of our noble youth is a matter
of much consequence; as early impressions
of this sort are necessary to fit them for the
commerce of the world, from which alone
they can hope to derive their best and most
solid instruction: and your gaiety on the fair
sex must not restrain me from agreeing with
them, in this instance, that I see not how
that world can be read and studied, as it ought
to be, without travelling.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Yes; now your Lordship comes to an important
point indeed. From the polish of
manners, the least considerable, and the easiest
to be attained of all the parts of good breeding,
your Lordship, as I now remember, rose at
once to a subject of real consequence, I mean,
<small>THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD</small>; a science,
as you well termed it, the most profound and
useful. And if this <small>MASTER-SCIENCE</small> were to
be acquired by means of early travel, our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
young gentleman should have my consent to
shut up his books, and set forth on his adventures,
directly.</p>

<p>But, good my Lord, consider with yourself
the difficulty of this study; the ripeness of
age and judgment necessary for entering upon
it; much more, for making a real progress
in it.</p>

<p>And why, as I before hinted, will your
Lordship be so impatient to come at the end,
without the means? Why, in such haste to
build up men, when nature has allotted a season
for their being boys?</p>

<p>Without doubt, if our youth could start up
men, at once, armed at all points, as the fable
has it, and thoroughly furnished for the business
of life, we should gladly accept this benefit,
and might then be content to overlook
or suppress all the cares of education. But
this is not the condition of humanity. Its improvements
of every kind are slow and gradual.
Time and attention form each; and it is only
through the right application of preceding
states, that we arrive, at length, at the maturity
of human wisdom. Let the child and
boy be allowed to perfect themselves in what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
belongs to those conditions, and it will then be
time enough to provide for the manly character.</p>

<p>Reflect with yourself, my Lord. When the
young unfurnished traveller is carried out into
the world, with no principles to poize his conduct,
no maxims to direct his judgment, what
can be expected from this untimely enterprize?
what, but fluctuating morals, and fortuitous
deliberations? He has not so much as the
idea of what constitutes <i>man</i>. How then
should he obtain any real and useful knowledge
of the human character?</p>

<p>If by a knowledge of the world, be only
meant a knowledge of the external modes and
customs of it, this, no doubt, were best acquired
by surveying them as they present
themselves in the various tribes and societies
of mankind. But your Lordship means more
than this: you understand a knowledge of a
higher kind; such as respects the creature
<i>man</i>, considered in his essential parts, his
<i>reason</i> and his <i>passions</i>. This is a different
kind of study, my Lord, from that other.
Any one that has eyes, is qualified to observe
the shapes and masks of men; but to penetrate
their interior frame, to inspect their proper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
dispositions and characters, is the business of
a well-informed and well-disciplined understanding.</p>

<p>Can your Lordship seriously expect that a
young boy should comprehend the effect,
which government, policy, institution, and
other circumstances of life, have on the pliant
reason of mankind? or that he should have
the skill to disentangle the various folds and
intricacies, in which their real characters lie
involved, through the insidious and discordant
working of the passions? He should surely
know what truth and reason is, before he can
derive any benefit to himself from the discourse
of men: and he should have carefully
watched the movements of his own heart, before
he presume to analyze, as your Lordship
expressed it, the characters of others.</p>

<p>You see, then, the unseasonableness and inutility
of foreign travel, as to the case in hand,
even on the supposition that our traveller were
admitted into what is called, the best company.
But how shall this privilege be obtained? In
what country can it be thought that the politeness
of eminent men will condescend to a
free and intimate communication with boys,
of whatever promising hopes, or illustrious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
quality? Certain slight and formal civilities,
your Lordship knows, are the utmost that can
be looked for; and are indeed the whole of
what our ill-prepared traveller is capable.</p>

<p>Your Lordship did well to remind me of
such societies as those in which you and I have,
at times, been engaged. The recollection is,
of course, flattering and agreeable. But let us
presume upon ourselves, my Lord; the <span class="smcap">Limborchs</span>
and <span class="smcap">Le Clercs</span> are not so obvious to
every body, as they were to us; or, if they
were, every body would not profit so well by
them. And if private scholars be thus inaccessible,
how shall we think to intrude on the
business and occupations of experienced magistrates
and ministers? And, putting both
these out of the question, who remain for the
tutorage and instruction of these travelled boys,
but such raw, unaccomplished companions, as
they left at home, and may find every where
in abundance?</p>

<p>Still my objections go further. What if,
by uncommon sagacity and good luck, some
acquaintance be made with superior persons,
and some little insight at length be gained into
their real characters? Of what mighty advantage
will this be in life, when their business
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
lies amongst other men; and when the same
industry and attention had brought them acquainted
with the characters of those, they
must act and live with? Foreigners are neither
an easier study than our own countrymen,
nor a more useful one. The very modes and
forms of external breeding catch the attention
of unexperienced youth; and are so many obstacles
to their real progress in this science.
And, when all is done, the modifications of
the human character, as existing at home, and
exhibited in the lives and actions of their fellow-citizens,
are, as I said, the proper objects
of their curiosity.</p>

<p>In short, the utmost I can allow to this
discipline of foreign travel, under the idea of
its furnishing <i>a knowledge of the world</i>, is,
That it may possibly wear a young man into
some studied and apish resemblance of the
models, he copies from, in his deportment
and manners; or that the various scenes, he
has passed through, may furnish matter, at
his return, for much unprofitable babble in
conversation: but, that he should come back
fraught with any solid information concerning
men and things, such as, in your Lordship’s
sublime phrase, may fit him to appear
with lustre in the court or senate of his own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
country, is what I can never promise myself
from this fashionable mode of education.</p>

<p>I am even disposed to promise myself the
less from it, for an <i>observation</i>, I have sometimes
had the opportunity of making.</p>

<p>An old man has so little about him to provoke
envy, that he may be allowed to make
the best of his former successes. And though
I pride myself in <i>one</i>, of a very delicate nature,
the boast of it will not be ill taken even
there, where your Lordship, with all your pretensions,
would be heard with no patience.
In short, I indulge myself in the vanity of
saying that I have, in my time, been well
with the fair sex, and have even been countenanced
so far as to be admitted into a degree
of acquaintance and familiarity with some ladies
of the highest quality and distinction.
And of these, I have constantly observed, that,
though bred up at home, they had a manifest
advantage over their travelled brothers, I was
going to say, in learning and science, but certainly
in true politeness, good sense, and even
a knowledge of the world.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>I understand this civility to the ladies, as a
decent atonement for your late freedoms with
them. In this light I should be unwilling to
cavil at it: and yet I see not, how your high
encomiums on the superior good sense and politeness
of these home-bred ladies can consist
with the passion, you before censured in them,
for foreign travel, as favourable, in their opinion,
to the production of such virtues.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>My consistency in this representation, I
doubt, is less questionable, than my civility.
For the ladies, on whom I bestowed those high,
but just encomiums, were chiefly such as I had
known in my younger days, before the passion
for travel had got among them. Now indeed
the case is altering apace, and the effects are
answerable. The virtues of the <i>English</i> ladies,
when they staid at home, were more conspicuous
than those of our travelled gentlemen. Now
that they, too, begin to travel, their follies are,
also, more glaring: in either case, I am willing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
to own, for the credit of my civility, from the
same reason, that both good and ill qualities
strike us most, when <i>set</i> in the precious metal
of that sex.</p>

<p>However, from the whole of my experience,
I must needs conclude, that this finishing of a
travelled education only serves to corrupt good
qualities, or inflame bad ones.</p>

<p>But the ladies are not in my province. If
they were, a knowledge of the world is not the
leading virtue I might wish to see them possessed
of. In the men, I confess, this accomplishment
is of more importance; and I am
therefore solicitous, that no well-meaning youth,
whom it so much concerns to gain a knowledge
of the world, should be misled in his
search of it.</p>

<p>Seriously, my Lord, the <small>WORLD</small>, which I
am forced to repeat so often, is a solemn word,
and the study of it has an air of something
plausible and imposing. But those, who know
what the world is, will think it best that a
young man begin with what is the first and
last concern of every man, the study of himself;
and if, in due time, he come to understand,
and, still more, to value as they deserve,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
the characters of the great and good men of
his own country, the opprobrious name of
<i>home-bred</i> will not hinder him from acquiring
the best fruit, with which a knowledge of the
world, rightly understood, can furnish him.</p>

<p>For, my Lord, I must not, on so inviting
an occasion as this, conceal an odd fancy of
mine from your Lordship.</p>

<p>The affair of <i>knowing the world</i>, about
which weak and fantastic people make so much
noise, and which one hears them perpetually
insisting upon with so much sufficiency, is of
all others the nicest and most momentous step
that is made in education. And, though volumes
have been written to teach us how we
may best become scholars, orators, courtiers,
what not; yet not one leaf do I ever remember
to have seen, composed by any capable man,
that instructs us in the proper way of getting
into this great secret.</p>

<p>It is not a matter to be entered upon, if I
were vain enough to think myself capable of it,
in this casual conversation; but thus much I
may presume to say, that whoever designs to
let a young man into a safe and useful knowledge
of the world, must do it in a way very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
remote from that which has hitherto been
taken.</p>

<p>A young man, they tell us, must know the
world; therefore, say they, push him into it
at once, that he may acquire that knowledge,
which his own experience, and not another’s,
must procure for him.</p>

<p>I, on the other hand, take upon me to say,
Therefore keep him out of that world, as long
as you can; and when you commit him to it,
let the ablest friend or tutor lend him his best
experience, to conduct him gradually, cautiously,
imperceptibly, into an acquaintance
with it.</p>

<p>You ask the reason of this mysterious procedure;
yet methinks it should be obvious
enough. From <i>sixteen to one and twenty</i> (a
period, in which the cares of an ordinary education
cease, or are much relaxed) is that precise
season of life, which requires all the attention
of the most vigilant, and all the address
of the wisest, governor. The passions are then
opening; curiosity awake; and the young
mind ready to take its ply from the seducements
of fashion, and creditable example.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<p>Nor is this the worst. An education, that
deserves the name, has inculcated maxims of
honour and probity; has inspired the noblest
sentiments of moral duty; has impressed on
the mind a veneration for all the virtues, and
an equal horror for all the vices, of humanity.</p>

<p>Full of these sublime ideas, which his parents,
his tutors, his books, and even his own
ingenuous heart has rendered familiar to him,
the fatal time is at hand, when our well-instructed
youth is now to make his entrance
into the world: but, good God, what a world!
not that which he has so long read, or dreamt
of; but a world, new, strange, and inconsistent
with all his former notions and expectations.</p>

<p>He enters this scene with awe; and contemplates
it with astonishment. Vice, he sees
assured, prosperous, and triumphant; virtue
discountenanced, unsuccessful, and degraded.
He joins the first croud, that presents itself to
him: a loud laugh arises; and the edge of their
ridicule is turned on sobriety, industry, honesty,
generosity, or some other of those qualities,
he has hitherto been most fond of.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

<p>He quits this clamorous set with disdain;
and is glad to unite himself with <i>another</i>, better
dressed, better mannered, in all respects
more specious and attractive.  His simplicity
makes him for some time the dupe of this plausible
society: but their occasional hints, their
negligent sarcasms, their sallies of wit, and polite
raillery on all that he has been accustomed
to hold sacred, shew him at last that he has
only changed his company, not mended it.</p>

<p>This discovery leads him to another.  He
attends to the lives of these well-bred people,
and finds them of a piece with their manners
and conversation; shewy indeed, and, on first
view, decorous; but, in effect, deformed by
every impotent and selfish passion; wasted in
sloth and luxury; in ruinous play; criminal
intrigues; or, at best, unprofitable amusements.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>This painting, methinks, is a little strong.
Besides, you might surely have provided better
company for your young inspector of the world,
than that shameless crew, or this corrupt one.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span></p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>I take up, as he must do, with such company
as the world is most apt to throw in our
way; and the colouring, your Lordship knows,
is modest enough for the occasion.</p>

<p>But I attend our boy-adventurer no further
in his progress into the world, and return now
to ask you, what effect your Lordship thinks
these strange unexpected scenes must naturally
have upon him? Certainly one or the other of
these two; either that the scorn of virtue, he
every where observes, will by degrees abate his
his reverence of it, and at length obliterate all the
better impressions of his education; or, if these
should still keep their hold of his young ingenuous
breast, that he will entertain the most
indignant sentiments of mankind, and suffer
himself to be carried by them into a sour and
sullen misanthropy, at least; perhaps into a
sceptical and prophane impiety.</p>

<p>I have seldom known a young man of sense
and parts, educated in this way, escape from
one or other of these mischiefs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>But why then bring him up with those high
notions of mankind, of which the world must
presently disabuse him, at the expence either
of his innocence, or good nature?</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>That question had been natural enough from
most men. But your Lordship knows very
well, that, in this moral discipline, as in every
other, ideas of excellence are to be imprinted
on the young mind, and the most consummate
models proposed for imitation: on this certain
principle, That, whoever would be moderately
accomplished in any art, and most of all in this
supreme art of life, must take his aim high,
and aspire to absolute perfection. A painter
or statuary of the lowest form, your Lordship
knows, is taught to work after a <span class="smcap">Madonna</span> <i>of</i>
<span class="smcap">Raphael</span>, or a <span class="smcap">Venus</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Medicis</span>; yet is not
likely to meet with either, among his acquaintance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>The observation is surely just; and I could
only mean that those high fancies should be
checked and moderated in due time, before our
entrance into that world, which, it is foreseen,
will so little correspond to them.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>And what is that <i>due time</i>, your Lordship
sets apart for this delicate operation?</p>

<p>Is it, before the young boy commences his
travels?  But that, according to your Lordship’s
scheme, is so early, that the regimen,
you would now abate, has not taken its full
effect, and his weak unconfirmed virtue would
die under the experiment.</p>

<p>Is it then, when his travels are already begun?
And is the sage tutor, your Lordship
anxiously flies to, as to some god, on every occasion
of distress, to charge himself with the
solution of this difficulty?  Alas!  now it is
too late. You have brought the boy into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
scene. He will see and judge for himself.
The torrent bears him away: the instant impression
is too strong to be counteracted by
the feeble and, now, disgusting admonitions of
a tutor.</p>

<p>See then, if the proper way, to secure him
from these inconveniences, be not, To keep
him yet at a distance from the world; and,
when you let him into some knowledge of it,
to do it seasonably, gradually, and circumspectly:
to take the veil off from some parts,
and leave it still upon others; to paint what he
does not see, and to hint at more than you
paint: to confine him, at first, to the best
company, and prepare him to make allowances
even for the best: to preserve in his breast the
love of excellence, and encourage in him the
generous sentiments, he has so largely imbibed,
and so perfectly relishes: yet temper,
if you can, his zeal with candour; insinuate to
him the prerogative of such a virtue, as his,
so early formed, and so happily cultivated;
and bend his reluctant spirit to some aptness
of pity towards the ill-instructed and the vicious:
by degrees to open to him the real condition
of that world, to which he is approaching;
yet so as to present to him, at the same
time, the certain inevitable misery of conforming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
to it: last of all, to shew him some examples
of that vice, which he must learn to bear
in others, though detest in himself; to watch
the effect these examples have upon him; and,
as you find his dispositions incline, to fortify
his abhorrence of vice, or excite his commiseration
of the vicious: in a word (for I am not
now directing a tutor, but suggesting, in very
general terms, my ideas of his office) to inform
the minds of youth with such gradual intelligence,
as may prepare them to see the world
without surprize, and live in it without danger.</p>

<p>This is that important chapter, which I presumed
to say no institutor of youth had yet
composed, or so much as touched upon, in a
treatise of education. You will learn from this
brief summary of its contents, what, in my
opinion, should be the employment of those
precious years, which are usually thrown away
upon foreign travel.</p>

<p>In earnest, my Lord, there is a fatal mistake
in this matter. People speak of a knowledge
of the world, as what may be acquired at any
time, and, for its importance, cannot be acquired
too soon. Alas! they forget, that a
long and careful preparation is necessary, before
we are qualified so much as to enter on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
this task; and that they, who are latest in setting
out, will arrive the soonest, certainly the
safest, at their journey’s end.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>But where shall this mighty work of preparation
be carried on? And in what privileged
sanctuary shall our good young man be kept
from the sight and contagion of this wicked
world, and yet be gradually forming for the
use and practice of it?</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Where, does your Lordship ask? Why, in
his college; in a friend’s, or his father’s house;
any where, in short, rather than in a foreign
country, where every wholesome restraint is
taken off, and the young mind left a prey to
every ill impression.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>And are there no inconveniences, on the
other hand, which a provident parent may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
supposed to foresee, and may be willing to
guard against?</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>I understand your Lordship. I know, that,
for want of better arguments in support of this
foreign breeding, weak or unworthy parents
are ready to take up with such as these:</p>

<p>They tell us, especially if of rank and quality,
that their children have suffered more than
enough already, in their passage through our
public and vulgar schools; that, together with
many illiberal habits, they have contracted many
low and illiberal friendships, which are, in all
reason, to be shaken off; that these unworthy
companions follow them to the University, and
are, if not the bane, yet the dishonour and incumbrance
of their future lives; that an absence
of some years abroad loosens these hasty
and ill-timed connexions; and leaves them, on
their return, at full liberty to contract others,
more suitable to their birth and quality, and
more conducive to their views of fortune, as
well as of reputation, in the world; that indeed
they might remove the young man immediately
from his school into their own house;
but that much of their time is necessarily spent
in the metropolis, the licence of which is not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
to be guarded against by any care of their own,
or of the best governor; that his low illiberal
acquaintance would haunt him even there; at
least, that the youth of his own age and rank
would naturally flock about him, and, under
a thousand pretences of civility or amusement,
engage him in all the follies, and perhaps the
vices, of this great town; that, on the whole,
his only refuge from these mischiefs is in the
way of foreign travel; whence, at length, he
may return in riper age and with better judgement
to take his station in the world.</p>

<p>To this popular talk (which your Lordship,
I suppose, glanced at, but would not condescend
to enforce directly) it is enough to reply,
that part of the inconveniences, here enumerated,
are feigned at pleasure, and the rest
exaggerated; that the authority of a father, if
he deserve that name, in concurrence with
honest friends and an ordinary governor, will
prevent them all, or at least palliate them; and
that, to take matters at the worst, his son will
be exposed to still greater inconveniences any
where else. But in truth I cannot see, if a
college be excepted against, and the business
be to see the world, as it is called, why <i>London</i>
should not be esteemed as fit a scene for
the purpose, as any other great town in <i>Europe</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
I think it contains as much good company
as any other; and I doubt whether it be
more licentious; or, if it be, there are three
restraints upon it, which, I am sure, will not
be found abroad: I mean, “the parental authority;”
“domestic government;” and “a
regard to reputation, under the eye and notice
of his friends.”</p>

<p>So that, in every view, whether on your
Lordship’s plan, of entering directly on the
great study of the world, or on mine, of only
preparing for it, our young man cannot possibly
do better, at his years, than stay at home;
where, if your Lordship please, we will then
leave him; at least, till we have tried the force
of your next, and, as I remember, <small>LAST</small> argument
in behalf of foreign travel, “which arose
out of the mighty benefits, supposed to attend
the study and cultivation of what are
called the <small>FINE ARTS</small>; in short, from the
lustre and importance of the virtuoso character.”</p>

<p>Your Lordship, who has so acknowledged a
taste in these things, and of course has so exquisite
a sense of their value, may be excused
for enlarging so particularly on this head. But
to me, who am of a plainer make and cooler
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
disposition, they appear, if not frivolous, yet
of little importance, when compared with those
other things, which are the proper and more
immediate objects of education.</p>

<p>It would, I doubt, disgust your Lordship,
should I speak my mind freely of them; or
even insinuate, that I take these studies, when
entered upon in early youth, and proposed as
matters of serious pursuit and application, to
have indeed the most pernicious tendency; as
breaking the nerves and force of the mind, and
inspiring I know not what of a trifling and superfluous
vanity.</p>

<p>To render these pursuits serviceable in any
degree, or even harmless, they should in all
reason be postponed to riper years, when the
confirmed judgment will of course take them
but for what they are, for nothing more than
elegant and polite amusements.</p>

<p>Not to insist, that to excel in this species of
taste, as in all others, a previous foundation is
required, of reflexion and good sense: for I
agree with your favourite poet; of every polite
study and indulgence even of the imagination,</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Sapere</span>, <i>est et principium et fons</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<p>These and still stronger objections might be
made to your partiality for the <i>fine arts</i>. But
I am contented to wave them all; as indeed
they would come with an ill grace from one,
who must acknowledge himself to have no particular
skill or discernment in them, and who
should not therefore presume to enter the lists
with so consummate a master of them as your
Lordship.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>And so, under the cover of a civil speech,
you escape from the most specious, at least, of
those arguments, which are alleged in favour
of an early travelled education. For, whether
it be true, or no, that other accomplishments
may be as well acquired at home, it is past a
doubt that the polite and liberal arts can only
be learnt abroad. And of their use and ornament
to our noble youth&mdash;</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Your Lordship, I know, can say more, and
finer things, than you expect I should seriously
dispute with you, on this occasion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

<p>I have now, my Lord, (at least if my old
memory has not betrayed me) gone over the
several heads and topics of your defence; and
said enough, I believe, on each, to shew that
foreign travel is not, on whatever side we view
it, the most proper method of a young gentleman’s
education.</p>

<p>The benefits, you propose by it, are either
of small account in themselves, at least of
much less account than those you must sacrifice
to them; or, when their importance is
real and confessed, may be attained more conveniently
in some other way, and at some
other season.</p>

<p>For, after all I have said, your Lordship is
not to conclude that I am wholly bent against
the practice of foreign travel. I am as sensible,
as any man, of its important use, when
undertaken at a proper time and by fit persons.
For, though I esteem it idleness, and something
worse, for a young boy to waste his
prime and most precious years in sauntering
round <i>Europe</i>, yet I know what ends of wisdom
and of virtue may be answered by a capable
man’s survey of it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

<p>But then, my Lord, I reckon that capacity
at no vulgar rate. He must be of worth and
consideration enough to be received into the
wisest, nay the greatest company. His natural
insight into men and things must be
quick and penetrating. His faculties must all
be at their height; his studies matured; and
his reading and observation extensive. With
these accomplishments, if a man of rank and
fortune can find leisure to employ a few years
among the neighbouring nations, I readily
agree, his voyage may turn out to his own
benefit, and to that of his country.</p>

<p>In this way it may be true, as your Lordship
insisted, that our island prejudices will
be usefully worn off, and much real civility
and politeness be imported among us.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>I thank you for this concession. Although
I cannot yet be convinced of the total impropriety
of an earlier voyage, I am pleased to find
you do not interdict the thing itself. Many
wise persons among us have even talked at
that rate. But you are more reasonable; and
indeed that extravagance was not to be apprehended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
from your true sense and superior
knowledge of human nature.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>I have that esteem of your Lordship’s kind
opinion, as to be very unwilling to forfeit any
share of it. Yet what I have now to advance
will, I readily foresee, expose me to some risk,
in that particular.</p>

<p>For now your Lordship has expressed your
regard for <i>a superior knowledge of human nature</i>,
it emboldens me to add that such knowledge
(which I have small right to claim
to myself) is not to be acquired but by
the largest and most extensive observation of
the human species: so that I may be found at
last even a warmer advocate for the uses of
foreign travel, than your Lordship.</p>

<p>I hold then that the knowledge of human
nature (the only knowledge, in the largest
sense of the expression, deserving a wise man’s
regard) can never be well attained but by
seeing it under all its appearances; I mean,
not merely, or chiefly, in that fair and well-dressed
form it wears amid the arts and embellishments
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
of our western world; but in its
naked simplicity, and even deformities; nay,
under all its disguises and distortions, arising
from absurd governments and monstrous religions,
in every distant region and quarter of
the globe.</p>

<p>The subject appears to me of that importance,
that it almost warms me, an old philosopher
as I am, into some emulation of your
Lordship’s enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I would say then, “that, to study <small>HUMAN
NATURE</small> to purpose, a traveller must enlarge
his circuit beyond the bounds of <i>Europe</i>.
He must go, and catch her undressed, nay
quite naked, in <i>North-America</i>, and at the
Cape of <i>Good Hope</i>. He may then examine
how she appears crampt, contracted, and
buttoned up close in the strait tunic of law
and custom, as in <i>China</i> and <i>Japan</i>: or,
spread out and enlarged above her common
size, in the loose and flowing robe of enthusiasm,
among the Arabs and Saracens: or,
lastly, as she flutters in the old rags of worn-out
policy and civil government, and almost
ready to run back naked to the deserts, as
on the <i>Mediterranean</i> coast of <i>Africa</i>.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

<p>These, my Lord, are the proper scenes for
the philosopher, for the citizen of the world,
to expatiate in. The tour of <i>Europe</i> is a
paltry thing: a tame, uniform, unvaried prospect:
which affords nothing but the same polished
manners and artificial policies, scarcely
diversified enough to take, or merit, our attention.</p>

<p>It is from a wider and more extensive view
of mankind that a just estimate is to be made
of the powers of human nature. Hence we
collect what its genuine faculties are: what
ideas and principles, or if any, are truly innate
and essential to it; and what changes and
modification it is susceptible of from law and
custom.</p>

<p>If you think I impose too great a task on
our inquisitive traveller, my next advice is,
That he stay at home: read <i>Europe</i> in the
mirror of his own country, which but too
eagerly reflects and flatters every state that
dances before its surface; and, for the rest, take
up with the best information he can get from
the books and narratives of the best voyagers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>That is, you discourage him from looking
abroad into the world of reason and civility,
the most natural state of mankind; and require
him to waste his time and observation
on slaves, madmen, or savages; states, in
which reason and civility have no place, and
where humanity itself, almost, disappears.</p>

<p>Admirable advice this, to come from a philosopher!
and still better, to send your disciple
to take his information of this unnatural disordered
scene from the lying accounts of ignorant,
ill-instructed, and gaping tale-tellers!</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>I was afraid, I should not be able to secure
to myself the good opinion, which your Lordship
was pleased to express of my <i>knowledge
of human nature</i>. This mortifying experience
puts an end to my adventurous flights, at
once; and forces me back again into the narrower
walk, which your Lordship seems
willing to prescribe to me.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<p>Be it then, as you insist, that an <i>English</i>
gentleman’s care should be, to accomplish
himself in the school of reason and civility;
to fit himself, in short, for that state which
your Lordship dignifies with the name of <i>natural</i>.
Still I declare against his <i>European</i>
travels.</p>

<p>The manners of each state are peculiar to
itself, and best adapted to it. The civility,
that prevails in some places on the continent,
may be more studied and exquisite than ours;
but not therefore to be preferred before it.
Those refinements have had their birth from
correspondent policies; to which they are well
suited, and from which they receive their
whole value. In the more absolute monarchies
of <i>Europe</i>, all are courtiers. In our freer
monarchy, all should be citizens. Let then
the arts of address and insinuation flourish in
<i>France</i>. Without them, what merit can pretend
to success, what talents open the way to favour
and distinction? But let a manlier character
prevail here. We have a prince to serve, not
to flatter: we have a country to embrace, not
a court to adore: we have, in a word, objects
to pursue, and interests to promote, from the
care of which our finer neighbours are happily
disburthened.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></p>

<p>Let our countrymen then be indulged in the
plainness, nay, the roughness of their manners:
but let them atone for this defect, by
their useful sense, their superior knowledge,
their public spirit, and, above all, by their
unpolished integrity.</p>

<p>Would your Lordship’s favourite Athens
have done wisely (or rather did it do so?) to
exchange the simplicity and manly freedom of
its ancient character, for the fopperies and
prostrations of the Asiatic courts? Nay,
would the softer accomplishments of Athens,
in its best state, have done well in a citizen of
<i>Sparta</i>?</p>

<p>Your Lordship sees what to conclude from
these hints. For my own part, my Lord, I
esteem politeness, in the reasonable sense of
the word, as the ornament, nay more, as the
duty of humanity. But, under colour of
making this valuable acquisition, let no culture
of the human mind, no instruction in letters
and business, no discipline of the passions, no
improvements of the head and heart, be neglected.
Let the foundation of these essential
virtues be laid deep in the usual forms of our
<i>public</i>, if you will, or (as you know I had rather)
in the way of a more attentive and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
moral, because <i>private</i>, education. Let the
commerce of the world, in due time and under
due regulation, succeed to this care; and
your Lordship will find your young gentleman
as fully accomplished in all respects as, in reason,
you should wish to see him. And for
proof of it, if I were not restrained, by a common
and perhaps false delicacy, from bringing
the names of our friends and acquaintance into
example in conversation, how many instances
of this sort could I point to, in such men as
your Lordship has known in your own country,
and is most disposed to reverence; and some of
them, possibly, in your own family!</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>Rather tell me, how we may reasonably
expect to see such models produced, according
to the vulgar way of our home-breeding: that
one or two such may, perhaps, after strict
search, be found among ourselves, I shall not
dispute with you.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>The search would cost me small pains. But
I press the matter no further. It is enough
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
that your Lordship sees I have my eye on
some, the most estimable, nay the  most accomplished
characters, that have been formed
among ourselves: and that even so envied a
thing, as a fine gentleman, has been fashioned
on this side the water. But the rarity of the
production, you think, makes against me,
and shews there is no trusting to the stubborn
soil and unfriendly climate of our country.
You conclude, upon the whole, for the expediency
of foreign travel, from the acknowledged
defects of our authorized seats of learning;
which, according to your Lordship’s idea
and representation of them, are so degenerate
and depraved, that nothing of worth and value
can be reasonably expected from that quarter.</p>

<p>This, after all, is your main reason for advising
a foreign education. Your spite is to
our Universities; and, to bribe, or rather provoke
me into the same quarrel, your Lordship
did not forget to remind me of the little obligation,
which I myself, who was trained in
their discipline, have had to them.</p>

<p>I could assent, perhaps, to some part of this
charge. It is certain, at least, that the prejudices,
the bigotry, the false learning, and narrow
principles, which have prevailed too much,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
and still prevail, in those famous seminaries,
create an unfavourable opinion of them in the
minds of many liberal and discerning persons.
Nay, I will not disown to you, that I have at
times been tempted myself to entertain, perhaps
to express, some resentment against them.
But we are always severe, generally unfair,
judges in our own case. And, to say the
truth, when the matter comes to be considered
impartially and coolly, their faults, of whatever
kind, will admit of much alleviation.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Universities of England</span>, your Lordship
knows, had their rise in the barbarous
ages. The views of their institutors were, accordingly,
such as might be expected from
men of their stamp, and in their circumstances.</p>

<p>These seminaries were more immediately
consecrated to the service of the church; which
is the less to be wondered at, as our statesmen,
you know, were, at that time, churchmen.
Hence the plan of studies, prescribed to the
youth, would be such as was best adapted to
the occasions of that class of men, in whose instruction
the public was more directly interested.</p>

<p>Besides, the learning of that time was rude
and barbarous; and, had their views been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
more enlarged, the founders of our colleges
had it not in their power to provide for the
encouragement of any other. The supreme
accomplishment even of our men of business
was little more than a readiness in the forms,
and a dexterity in the quirks, of the canon
law: and the pride of the most profound scholars
lay in applying the subtleties of the Aristotelian
philosophy to theologic and metaphysical
questions; whence too much stress was
evidently laid on logical exercises and scholastic
disputations.</p>

<p>’Tis true, some few of our colleges were
erected at a time, when something more light
and knowledge had broke in upon us; I mean,
during the progress of the <i>Reformation</i>. But
the great object that filled all men’s minds
being the dispute with the see of <i>Rome</i>, the
principal circumstance that distinguishes these
later foundations from the other is, that their
statutes provide more especially for the management
of that controversy. So that, even
in these societies, the scholastic disputative
genius still prevailed, to the exclusion of that
more liberal plan of studies, which is fitted to
all times, and would have suited better to the
general purpose of these established seats of
education.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>This account of the institution and genius
of our <i>English</i> Universities may be easily
credited, even from what we now see of them.
But, though some causes may be assigned for
the introduction of these barbarous plans of
education, what reason can be given why they
should be cherished in our days, or that men
of sense should submit to them?</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>The reason is not far to seek. These barbarous
plans of education had, we have seen,
in former times, both their reason and their
use. Bodies of men retain the character of
their first institution very long; and, all things
considered, I am inclined to think it not amiss
that they do so. Universities and schools of
learning, in particular, should not be in haste
to exchange established principles and practices,
which the best sense of former ages had introduced,
for novel and untried pretensions. The
reason is plain: their instructions would have
small weight, and their discipline no stability,
amid such easy and perpetual changes. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
are, indeed, the depositaries of the public wisdom
and virtue; and their business is, to inculcate
both on the rising generation, upon the
footing on which they are received and understood
in the several countries where they are
erected. Even if their local statutes laid them
under no restraint, an easiness in departing
from established rules were a levity not to be
commended; and would, in the end, be unfavourable
to truth itself, when at any time it
should come, in its turn, to be entertained
among them.</p>

<p>The truth is, my Lord, we are ready to
consider these seminaries as schools of philosophy,
strictly so called: whereas their proper
character is that of schools of learning and
education. Under this last idea, much of that
bigotry and prejudice is to be looked for, and
should be excused, which would rightly be objected
to them under that other denomination.</p>

<p>Hence then, I conceive, a just apology may
be made for the present condition of our Universities.
If they have not, in all respects,
corrected the vices of their original institution,
let the influence and authority of such institution
be pleaded in their excuse; and if certain
inveterate errors in speculation (for I know
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
your Lordship’s chief quarrel to them) not immediately
connected with their institution,
happen still to maintain their credit in those
places, let it be considered that the general
sense of the public should in all reason be expected
to go before their profession and propagation
even of right principles. Believe it,
my Lord, as reason and sound philosophy
make a progress among us, these bodies will
gradually, though reluctantly indeed, reform
themselves: and the service they will then
render to truth will be the greater for the opposition
they now make to it.</p>

<p>I have ventured to say, that this reformation
will, in due time, come of itself. I think, it
certainly <i>will</i>; as well in regard to the general
plan of their studies, as their particular principles
and opinions. Yet, in respect of the
<i>former</i> at least, it might perhaps be something
quickened by external application. I know
the attempt is delicate and difficult; but it
might possibly succeed, if carried on under
cover of some still greater reformation; which
seizes the mind with much force, turns it to
a new bias, and makes it propitious to every
thing that tends to the attainment of its principal
object.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span></p>

<p>Such occasions do not present themselves
every day. One such we have seen; but we
missed the season. Whatever was fundamentally
wrong in the constitution of the Universities,
should have been set right in that great
&aelig;ra, when the church was reformed. The
undertaking had been of a piece with the rest
of that extraordinary work; and the opportunity
was inviting. But whether the minds of
men were then ripe for this other reformation,
or whether there was indeed light enough in
the nation at that time fully and properly to
effect it, may not unreasonably, I know, be
made a question with your Lordship.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>It is no question at all with me, whether
any service of that kind was to be expected
from those great dealers in church-work. Perhaps
another and <i>later</i> &aelig;ra may be pointed
out, when the same office might, and should,
have been undertaken by our political craftsmen.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Your Lordship means at the <i>Revolution</i>;
and, as the generous principles of liberty, on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
which the Revolution was founded, had received
but little countenance from the Universities,
this consideration, you will say, afforded
the best pretence for attempting their reformation.
But wise men saw, that the credit which
those learned bodies had drawn to themselves,
and indeed deservedly, by their late conduct,
notwithstanding their speculative systems and
conclusions, was at that time too high, to suffer
a rigorous inspection to be made into their
statutes and constitutions: they saw, in that
convulsion of the state, it would be impossible
to carry on a design of this nature, without
endangering the new settlement, or exposing it
at least to many odious and inconvenient imputations:
and they saw, besides, that the
spirit of liberty, which had prevailed so far as
to reform the state itself, would insensibly extend
its influence to all subordinate societies.</p>

<p>In a word, the close and immediate connexion,
which the Universities have with the
church, made it natural and highly reasonable
to expect that both should have shared the
same fate at the <i>Reformation</i>: but the necessity
was not so urgent, or so visible at least,
that the Universities should be new-modelled,
at the <i>Revolution</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

<p>However, my Lord, what the wisdom of
<i>either</i> age omitted, or was unable to do, time,
and that desuetude which attends upon it, will
gradually bring about; not to say, has in some
measure accomplished. And, to take matters
as they now are, the studies and discipline of
the Universities are not without their use, and
should not be too violently declaimed against
and degraded.</p>

<p>The elements of literature are reasonably
well taught in those places. At least, the familiarity,
which men have with the learned
languages (the proper foundation, as I dare
say your Lordship holds, of all real learning
and politeness) is very much owing to the lectures
of our colleges. And, though I am sensible
what exceptions are to be made in other
respects, yet, on the whole, religion, and good
morals, receive an advantage from their institutions,
and the regularity of their discipline.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>Yes; their religion is intolerance; and their
morals, servility. For, as to any freedom of
manly thought, or the dignity of virtue&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>You are ready to look for them any where
else than in our <i>English</i> Universities.</p>

<p>Come on then, my Lord: have the goodness
to point out to us those happier seminaries,
where these and all other virtues are more successfully
propagated.</p>

<p>But which way will your Lordship direct us
to take, in this search? Shall we turn to the
North of this country for those advantages,
which we despair of finding in the South? Or,
because the grossness of our island air may infect
all parts alike, shall we shape our course
to the Continent? And does your Lordship
encourage us to look for some <i>Athens</i> amidst
the Protestant states of <i>Germany</i>, in the <i>Netherlands</i>,
or the <i>Swiss</i> Cantons?</p>

<p>These, I take it, are the only scenes which
your Lordship can have in view; for, as high
as their reputation may be in this respect, you
would hardly advise the breeding of our <i>English</i>
youth in the colleges of the Jesuits.</p>

<p>One word then, if you please, on these
Protestant Universities on the Continent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<p>Your Lordship and I have had some experience
of the state of literature and education
in those places. Eminent and excellent men
they surely have amongst them. But so,
your Lordship will confess, have the Universities
of <i>England</i>. If we do not readily find
those who, at this day, may be opposed to a
<span class="smcap">Limborch</span> or a <span class="smcap">Le Clerc</span>; yet it is not long
since we had to boast of a <span class="smcap">Chillingworth</span>, a
<span class="smcap">Cudworth</span>, and a <span class="smcap">Whichcot</span>; all, men of
manly thought, generous minds, and incomparable
learning.</p>

<p>But the question is not, you know, of particular
men, which such great bodies rarely
want; but, of the general frame and constitution
of learned societies, fit for the purposes of
polite and liberal education.</p>

<p>Shall we say then, that the scattered tribes
of students in a <i>Dutch</i> or <i>Swiss</i> town are likely
to be better instructed, or better governed,
than the young scholars in our colleges; or,
that the good order, discipline, and sobriety
of these places, is to be compared with the
anarchy and licence of those other?</p>

<p>Your Lordship, I know, takes a pleasure to
conceive of certain foreign academies, as of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
that <small>ANCIENT</small> one, where the students visited,
without constraint, the schools of philosophers,
and even bore a part in their free conferences
and disputations: you even love to paint the
noble youth to yourself, as of old, spatiating,
at their leisure, in shady walks and porticos,
and imbibing the principles of science as they
drop upon them in the dews of Attic eloquence
and politeness.</p>

<p>All this, my Lord, is very well: yet, setting
aside a certain colouring of expression which
takes and amuses the imagination, I see but
little to admire in this picture; certainly not
enough to make one regret the want of the
original, and seriously to prefer this easy manner
of breeding, to that stricter form which
prevails in our own Universities: where the day
begins and ends with religious offices: where
the diligence of the youth is quickened and relieved,
in turn, by stated hours of study and
recreation: where temperance and sobriety are
even <i>convivial</i> virtues; and the two extremes
of a festive jollity and unsocial gloom are happily
tempered by the decencies of a <i>common
table</i>; where, in a word, the discipline of
Spartan <span class="smcap">Halls</span> and the civility of Athenian
<span class="smcap">Banquets</span> are, or may be, united.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

<p>Surely, my Lord, these wholesome regulations,
with many others that might be mentioned,
could we but strip them of the opprobrious
name of collegiate and monastic, are of
another use and value in education, than the
lax unrestrained indulgence of foreign seminaries.</p>

<p>But, were there even no difference in this
respect, as there is surely a great deal, are we
to reckon for nothing the disparity of civil and
religious constitutions?</p>

<p>Your Lordship, I dare say, will not suspect
me of a bigoted adherence to any mere <i>mode</i> of
civil or ecclesiastical regimen. But is it all
one, whether a young boy, who is destined to
be a subject to the crown, and a member of
the church of <i>England</i>, be inured to the equality
of republican governments, and of calvinistical
churches? It may be well for men of
confirmed age and ability to look into both;
but would you train up your son in a way that
is likely to indispose him, right or wrong, to
the institutions of his own country?</p>

<p>Besides, are there fewer prejudices, think
ye, in the men of other churches and governments,
than our own? or, are their professors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
and institutors of youth more free from popular
errors and blind attachments, though of a
different sort, than the tutors and masters of
education in our country?</p>

<p>Nay, consider with yourself, my Lord; is
there not as much tyranny in the administration
of some they call <i>free states</i>; and as much
restraint and persecution in the principles of
some they call <i>free churches</i>, as can fairly be
charged on the monarchy or church of <i>England</i>?</p>

<p>So that what you could expect to gain by
preferring these foreign schools of learning to
your own, I cannot easily imagine. All that
is worth acquiring in either, you have, at least,
an equal chance to meet with at home: and
what should be avoided, may, nay must, with
more probability, be encountered abroad.</p>

<p>But your Lordship, perhaps, would confine
your young traveller to no <i>one</i> seat of learning;
and have it only in view to convey him hastily,
under the wing of a tutor, through many a famous
academy, without settling him in any.
This, I must confess, is the way to keep clear
of prejudices; but, whether any solid instruction,
or just science either of men or things, is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
to be gathered from so cursory an education,
your Lordship will do well to consider.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>You have done me the favour to imagine
many projects and designs for me, which I was
too dull to entertain in my own thoughts. But,
if the education of a young man of rank and
quality cannot be carried on without the assistance
of academical instructors, I would much
sooner trust him to the care of such as the more
free and liberal genius of certain foreign Universities
has formed, than submit him to the
tutorage of those priestly guides, to whom
our narrow and slavish institutions have consigned
the province of education, in our own
country.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Your Lordship now indeed speaks out very
plainly. Your objection, then, is to <span class="smcap">Clergy-tutors</span>;
and you think it absurd and even
pernicious to commit our noble and liberal
youth to the care of churchmen. You would
rather see them in lay-hands; in the hands of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
philosophers, properly so called; who, indifferent
to every thing but pure truth and reason,
are in no danger of imbibing wrong principles
themselves, and are therefore under no temptation
of instilling any such into the minds of
their followers.</p>

<p>The thought is happy, my Lord; and, if a
number of these philosophers could any where
be found, I might be induced to fall into the
project of employing such only in the province
of education. But, the condition, in which
truth and reason are now left, and seem likely
to continue, in this world of ours, affords little
room for such flattering expectations. An unprejudiced
instructor, I doubt, is a rarity not
to be met with, I do not say in our Universities,
but even out of them: and, prejudices for
prejudices, some persons may be apt to think
those of a churchman as tolerable as of any
other.</p>

<p>But, my Lord, having no particular bias on
my own mind in favour of that order, and having
something perhaps to <i>resent</i> from several
individuals of it, it will not misbecome me to
hazard a word or two, in its vindication.</p>

<p>You will permit me then to say, that I see
no peculiar unfitness in the clergy for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
office, they are called to, in this country, of
superintending the business of education. The
leisure they enjoy; the various learning and
general studies, which that leisure enables
them, and their profession obliges them, to
pursue; and, lastly, the strictness of life and
manners, or, if you will, the very decorum,
which their character imposes upon them;
these circumstances seem generally to have
marked them out, as the properest persons to
form the manners and cultivate the minds of
youth, in all countries. In our <i>own</i>, that propriety
strikes one the more, since their prejudices,
of whatever kind, are but in common
to them with other speculative and studious
men; and since even their interest, rightly understood,
and as seen by the best and wisest
of themselves, (whatever may have been warmly
and passionately said by some persons) is in no
degree separate from that of the great community,
to which they belong.</p>

<p>Yes, your Lordship will say, their hopes
and views of preferment&mdash;</p>

<p>Yet, in this respect, they are but on a level
with other men of most other professions; nay,
with all men out of them, that aspire to rise,
by their merits or the favour of their superiors,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
to any distinction in the world. And though
we commonly say, that the clergy should be
<i>only</i> animated by purer motives, yet you cannot
expect, nay would not seriously wish, that
they should be altogether insensible to such as
these.</p>

<p>It is true, in countries where the clergy have
a dependance on some foreign power, or where
they have usurped an independent power to
themselves, or where, lastly, the civil constitution
is so ill defined that the privileges of the
subject lie at the mercy of the prince; in each
of these cases, the ambition of the clergy may
be, and in fact has been, productive of many
public mischiefs. But our Protestant clergy,
who are in no foreign subjection, claim no independency,
and fill their place in a system all
whose parts are, now at least, exactly regulated
by known laws, cannot, by their private
ambition, disturb the general interest, and
have no peculiar inducements to attempt it.
And though particulars may sometimes, by
their follies and indiscretions, dishonour themselves,
yet the effect cannot be considerable,
and certainly affords no good reason for taking
the province of education, for which on so
many accounts they are well qualified, out of
their hands.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<p>Your Lordship’s candour and equity will
then, upon the whole, permit an obvious distinction
to be made between the <small>MEN</small> and their
<small>PROFESSION</small>. Too many of the sacred order, I
confess, and am sorry for it, seem now to have
their minds perverted by those principles, and
heated by those passions, which do little credit
to their function, or themselves; and are equally
inconsistent with the genius of that religion
they profess to teach, as they are unfriendly to
that legal constitution both of church and state,
which they have bound themselves to support.
But their <i>profession</i> is little concerned in all
this; and in a succession or two of these men
(if the present set be, many of them, incorrigible)
you may surely reckon upon all those
prejudices and passions being worked off, which
now administer the occasion of so much dislike
to it.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>Well, but <i>clergy-manners</i>; will they, too,
be worked off, with their other infirmities?</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Perhaps, they may; if not, forgive them
this one defect; at least, if it be their only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
one. But you do not mean, that the manners
of the clergy, <i>as such</i>, are more offensive than
those of other people. They are suited to their
profession and way of life, from which they
naturally result; and if the clergy have not
that gloss upon them, which sets off the manners
of finer men, they rarely disgust you with
the affectation of it. But, after all, if persons
of your Lordship’s quality and breeding would
condescend to countenance them a little, they
would, doubtless, brighten under your eye;
and might come in time to reflect somewhat of
that high polish, which glistens so much in the
address and conversation of their betters.</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>What transmutations they may undergo
hereafter, and by what means, I am not curious
to enquire. On this head, their candid
apologist is at liberty to be as much in jest, or
in earnest, as he thinks fit. But from what
appears at present, I must take leave, in my
turn, to think less reverendly, than He would
have me, of our sacred instructors; and though
I value some particular persons of the order, as
much as any man, yet, till I see a greater
change in the principles, temper, and manners
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
of that body, than, I fear, is likely to come to
pass in our days, I can have no very favourable
sentiments of those rude, illiberal, and monkish
seminaries, where such worthies preside.</p>

<h4>MR. LOCKE.</h4>

<p>Let us have patience, my Lord. I have not
scrupled to confess to you, that much is, at
present, amiss in those seminaries, and wants
to be set right. But so, God knows, there is
every where else. As our factions and parties
both in religion and government die away, the
Universities will become more reasonable; and
as the general manners refine, they too will,
of course, take a better air and polish. In a
word, they may not lead the public taste or
judgment; but, as I said, they will be sure to
follow it.</p>

<p>And the happy period is not, perhaps, far
off. For, now I have taken upon me to divine
so much of the future condition of our Universities,
let me paint to you more particularly
what I conceive of their growing improvements;
and, in a kind of prophetic strain,
such as old age, they say, pretends to, and
may be indulged in, delineate to you a faint
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
prospect of those brighter days, which I see
rising upon us.</p>

<p>“The <small>TIME</small> will come, my Lord, and I even
assure myself it is at no great distance, when
the Universities of <i>England</i> shall be as respectable,
for the learning they teach, the
principles they instil, and the morals they
inculcate, as they are now contemptible, in
your Lordship’s eye at least, on these several
accounts.</p>

<p>“I see the day, when a scholastic theology
shall give place to a rational divinity, conducted
on the principles of sound criticism
and well interpreted scripture: when their
sums and systems shall fly before enlightened
reason and sober speculation: when a fanciful,
precarious, and hypothetic philosophy,
shall desert their schools; and be replaced
by real science, supporting itself on the sure
grounds of experiment and cautious observation:
when their physics shall be fact; their
metaphysics, common sense; and their ethics,
human nature.</p>

<p>“Do I flatter myself with fond imaginations,
my Lord? Or is not the time at hand, when
St. <span class="smcap">Paul</span> shall lecture our divines, and not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
<span class="smcap">Calvin</span>; our <span class="smcap">Bacons</span> and <span class="smcap">Boyles</span> expel
<span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>; Mr. <span class="smcap">Newton</span> fill the chair of
<span class="smcap">Des Cartes</span>; and even your friend (if your
Lordship can forgive the arrogance of placing
himself by the side of such men) take the
lead of <span class="smcap">Burgersdicius</span>?</p>

<p>“Still, my Lord, my prophetic eye penetrates
further. Amidst these improvements
in real science, the languages shall be learnt
for use, and not pedantry: Your Lordship’s
admired ancients shall be respected, and not
idolized: the forms of classic composition be
emulated: and a set of men arise, even beneath
the shade of our academic cloysters,
that shall polish the taste, as well as advance
the knowledge, of their country.</p>

<p>“Yet, I am but half way in the portraiture
of my vision. The appointed lecturers of
our youth, whom your Lordship loves to
qualify with the name of <i>bearded boys</i>, shall
adopt the manners of men; shall instruct
with knowledge, and persuade with reason;
shall be the first to explode slavish doctrines
and narrow principles; shall draw respect to
themselves, rather from the authority of their
characters, than of their places; and, which
is the first and last part of a good education,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
set the noble and ingenuous youth intrusted
to their care, the brightest examples of diligence,
sobriety, and virtue.</p>

<p>“Perhaps in those days, a freer commerce
shall be opened with the world: the students
of our colleges be ambitious of appearing in
good company: and a general civility prevail,
where your Lordship sees nothing, at
present, but barbarism and rudeness.</p>

<p>“Nay, who knows but, in this different
state of things, the arts themselves may gain
admission into these seminaries; and even
the exercises be taught there, which our
noble youth are now sent to acquire on the
Continent?</p>

<p>“Such, I persuade myself, if the presage of
old experience may pass for any thing, is
the happier scene which a little time shall
disclose to your view, in our <i>English</i> Universities.
What its duration may be, I cannot
discover. Much will depend on the general
manners, and the public encouragement.
In the mean time, if any cloud rest
upon it, it will not, I assure myself, arise
immediately from within, but from the little,
or, which is worse, the ill-directed favour,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
which the Great shall vouchsafe to shew to
places, so qualified, and so deserving their
protection.</p>

<p>“Yet, after all I have seen, or perhaps
dreamt, as your Lordship may rather object
to me, of the future flourishing estate of our
Universities, and of their extreme fitness in
all respects to answer the ends of their institution,
I cannot be mistaken in one prediction,
“that the mode of early Travel will still
continue; perhaps its fury will increase; and
our youth of quality be still sent abroad for
their education, when every reason shall
cease which your Lordship has now alleged
in favour of that practice.”</p>

<h4>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h4>

<p>This last prediction may, perhaps, be true;
I mean, if those others should ever be accomplished.
But as I have no great faith in modern
prophecy, and see at present no symptoms
of this coming age of gold, which your
fancy has now presented to us, you must excuse
me if these <i>prophetic strains</i>, as you
termed them, have no great weight with me
before their completion. Should that ever happen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
I shall respect your foresight, at least;
and rejoice extremely at an event, which, I
shall then freely own, will leave my countrymen
no excuse for their folly.</p>

<p>This, Sir, was the substance of what passed
between us on the subject in question. Our
other friends interposed, indeed, at times; but
rarely, and in few words; and I have rather
chosen to mix their occasional observations
with our own, than perplex and lengthen this
recital by a more punctilious exactness. Besides,
I could not think it civil to introduce
my friends upon the scene, only to shew them,
as it were, for mutes; their politeness to us,
who were principals in the debate, being such,
as to restrain them from bearing any considerable
part in it. Yet this way of relation would,
no doubt, have given something more of life
to the sketch I here send you; as their presence,
you may believe, certainly did to the
original conversation.</p>

<p>It is enough to say, that nothing more material,
than what I have now related to you,
passed on the occasion. For by this time the
day was pretty well spent, and it was necessary
for us to withdraw to our several engagements.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<p>For myself, I leave you to guess the effect
which our philosopher’s grave remonstrance
left upon me. One thing you will think remarkable;
that the part of arraigning the present
state of things should fall to my share;
while he, at an age that is naturally querulous
and dissatisfied, was employed in defending it.
Whether this be a proof of his wisdom, or
good spirits, I pretend not to say. But it gave
me a pleasure to hear the old man indulging
himself in the prospect of better days, of which,
as young as we are, and as warmly as we wish
for them, you and I had always despaired.

CHIVALRY <small>AND</small> ROMANCE.</h2>

<h4 id="I">LETTER I.</h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> ages, we call barbarous, present us
with many a subject of curious speculation.
What, for instance, is more remarkable than
the <i>Gothic</i> <span class="smcap">Chivalry</span>? or than the spirit of
<span class="smcap">Romance</span>, which took its rise from that singular
institution?</p>

<p>Nothing in human nature, my dear friend,
is without its reasons. The modes and fashions
of different times may appear, at first sight,
fantastic and unaccountable. But they, who
look nearly into them, discover some latent
cause of their production.</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Nature once known, no prodigies remain,”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<p>as sings our philosophical bard; but to come
at this knowledge, is the difficulty. Sometimes
a close attention to the workings of the
human mind is sufficient to lead us to it:
sometimes more than that, the diligent observation
of what passes without us, is necessary.</p>

<p>This last I take to be the case here. The
prodigies we are now contemplating, had their
origin in the barbarous ages. Why then, says
the fastidious modern, look any further for
the reason? Why not resolve them at once
into the usual caprice and absurdity of barbarians?</p>

<p>This, you see, is a short and commodious
philosophy. Yet barbarians have their <i>own</i>,
such as it is, if they are not enlightened by our
reason. Shall we then condemn them unheard,
or will it not be fair to let them have the telling
of their own story?</p>

<p>Would we know from what causes the institution
of <i>Chivalry</i> was derived? The time
of its birth, the situation of the barbarians
amongst whom it arose, must be considered:
their wants, designs, and policies, must be
explored: we must inquire when, and where,
and how, it came to pass that the Western
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
world became familiarized to this <i>prodigy</i>,
which we now start at.</p>

<p>Another thing is full as remarkable, and
concerns us more nearly. The spirit of Chivalry
was a fire which soon spent itself: but
that of <i>Romance</i>, which was kindled at it,
burnt long, and continued its light and heat
even to the politer ages.</p>

<p>The greatest geniuses of our own and foreign
countries, such as <span class="smcap">Ariosto</span> and <span class="smcap">Tasso</span> in
<i>Italy</i>, and <span class="smcap">Spenser</span> and <span class="smcap">Milton</span> in <i>England</i>,
were seduced by these barbarities of their forefathers;
were even charmed by the <i>Gothic</i>
Romances. Was this caprice and absurdity in
them? Or, may there not be something in
the <i>Gothic</i> Romance peculiarly suited to the
views of a genius, and to the ends of poetry?
And may not the philosophic moderns have gone
too far in their perpetual ridicule and contempt
of it?</p>

<p>To form a judgment in the case, the rise,
progress, and genius of <i>Gothic</i> Chivalry must
be explained.</p>

<p>The circumstances in the <i>Gothic</i> fictions
and manners, which are proper to the ends of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
poetry (if any such there be) must be pointed
out.</p>

<p>Reasons, for the decline and rejection of the
<i>Gothic</i> taste in later times, must be given.</p>

<p>You have in these particulars both the Subject
and the <span class="smcap">Plan</span> of the following Letters.

<h4 id="II">LETTER II.</h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">I&nbsp;look</span> upon Chivalry, as on some mighty
river, which the fablings of the poets have
made immortal. It may have sprung up
amidst rude rocks, and blind deserts. But
the noise and rapidity of its course, the extent
of country it adorns, and the towns and palaces
it ennobles, may lead a traveller out of
his way, and invite him to take a view of those

</div></div></div>

<p>I enter, without more words, on the subject
I began to open to you in my last letter.</p>

<p>The old inhabitants of these North-West
parts of <i>Europe</i> were extremely given to the
love and exercise of arms. The feats of <span class="smcap">Charlemagne</span>
and our <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>, in particular, were
so famous as in later times, when books of
Chivalry were composed, to afford a principal
subject to the writers of them<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

<p>But <span class="smcap">Chivalry</span>, properly so called, and under
the idea of “a distinct military order,
conferred in the way of investiture, and accompanied
with the solemnity of an oath
and other ceremonies, as described in the
old historians and romancers,” was of later
date, and seems to have sprung immediately
out of the <span class="smcap">Feudal Constitution</span>.</p>

<p>The first and most sensible effect of this
constitution, which brought about so mighty
a change in the policies of <i>Europe</i>, was the
erection of a prodigious number of petty tyrannies.
For, though the great barons were
closely tied to the service of their Prince by
the conditions of their tenure, yet the power
which was given them by it over their own
numerous vassals was so great, that, in effect,
they all set up for themselves; affected an independency;
and were, in truth, a sort of absolute
Sovereigns, at least with regard to one
another. Hence, their mutual aims and interests
often interfering, the feudal state was, in
a good degree, a state of war: the feudal chiefs
were in frequent enmity with each other: the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
several combinations of feudal tenants were so
many separate armies under their head or
chief: and their castles were so many fortresses,
as well as palaces, of these puny princes.</p>

<p>In this state of things one sees, that all imaginable
encouragement was to be given to the
use of arms, under every different form of attack
and defence, according as the safety of
these different communities, or the ambition
of their leaders, might require. And this
condition of the times, I suppose, gave rise to
that military institution, which we know by
the name of <span class="smcap">Chivalry</span>.</p>

<p>Further, there being little or no security to
be had amidst so many restless spirits and the
clashing views of a neighbouring numerous
and independent nobility, the military discipline
of their followers, even in the intervals of
peace, was not to be relaxed, and their ardour
suffered to grow cool, by a total disuse of martial
exercises. And hence the proper origin
of <span class="smcap">Justs</span> and <span class="smcap">Turnaments</span>; those images of
war, which were kept up in the castles of the
barons, and, by an useful policy, converted
into the amusement of the knights, when their
arms were employed on no serious occasion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>

<p>I call this the <i>proper origin</i> of Justs and
Turnaments; for the date of them is carried
no higher, as far as I can find, even in <i>France</i>
(where unquestionably they made their first
appearance) than the year 1066; which was
not till after the introduction of the feudal government
into that country. Soon after, indeed,
we find them in <i>England</i> and in <i>Germany</i>;
but not till the feudal policy had spread itself
in those parts, and had prepared the way for
them.</p>

<p>You see, then, my notion is, that Chivalry
was no absurd and freakish institution, but the
natural and even sober effect of the feudal policy;
whose turbulent genius breathed nothing
but war, and was fierce and military even in
its amusements.</p>

<p>I leave you to revolve this idea in your own
mind. You will find, I believe, a reasonable
foundation for it in the history of the feudal
times, and in the spirit of the feudal government.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<h4 id="III">LETTER III.</h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">If</span> the conjecture, I advanced, of the rise of
Chivalry, from the circumstances of the feudal
government, be thought reasonable, it will not
be difficult to account for the several <small>CHARACTERISTICS</small>
of this singular profession.</p>

<p>I. “The passion for arms; the spirit of enterprize;
the honour of knighthood; the
rewards of valour; the splendour of equipages;”
in short, every thing that raises our
ideas of the prowess, gallantry, and magnificence
of these sons of <span class="smcap">Mars</span>, is naturally and
easily explained on this supposition.</p>

<p>Ambition, interest, glory, all concurred,
under such circumstances, to produce these
effects. The feudal principles could terminate
in nothing else. And when, by the necessary
operation of that policy, this turn was given to
the thoughts and passions of men, use and
fashion would do the rest; and carry them to
all the excesses of military fanaticism, which
are painted so strongly, but scarcely exaggerated,
in the old Romances.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p>II. “Their romantic ideas of justice; their
passion for adventures; their eagerness to
run to the succour of the distressed; and the
pride they took in redressing wrongs, and
removing grievances;” all these distinguishing
characters of genuine Chivalry are explained
on the same principle. For, the feudal
state being a state of war, or rather of almost
perpetual violence, rapine, and plunder, it
was unavoidable that, in their constant skirmishes,
stratagems, and surprizes, numbers of
the tenants or followers of one Baron should
be seized upon and carried away by the followers
of another: and the interest, each had
to protect his own, would of course introduce
the point of honour, in attempting by all
means to retaliate on the enemy, and especially
to rescue the captive sufferers out of the
hands of their oppressors.</p>

<p>It would be meritorious, in the highest degree,
to fly to their assistance, when they
knew where they were to be come at; or to
seek them out with diligence, when they did
not. This last <i>feudal</i> service soon introduced,
what may be truly called <i>romantic</i>, the <i>going
in quest of adventures</i>; which at first, no
doubt, was confined to those of their own
party, but afterwards, by the habit of acting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
on this principle, would be extended much
further. So that in process of time, we find
the Knights errant, as they were now properly
styled, wandering the world over in search of
occasions on which to exercise their generous
and disinterested valour, indifferently to friends
and enemies in distress;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>III. “The courtesy, affability, and gallantry,
for which these adventurers were so
famous, are but the natural effects and consequences
of their situation.”</p>

<p>For the castles of the Barons were, as I said,
the courts of these little sovereigns, as well as
their fortresses; and the resort of their vassals
thither in honour of their chiefs, and for their
own proper security, would make that civility
and politeness, which is seen in courts and insensibly
prevails there, a predominant part in
the character of these assemblies.</p>

<p>This is the poet’s own account of</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&mdash;&mdash;court and royal citadel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great school-maistresse of all Courtesy.<br /></span>
<span class="author"><small>B. III. C.</small> vi. s. 1.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span></p>

<p>And again, more largely in <small>B. VI. C.</small> i. s. 1.</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of Court it seems men Courtesie do call,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For that it there most useth to abound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well beseemeth that in Princes hall<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That Virtue should be plentifully found,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which of all goodly manners is the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And root of civil conversation:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Right so in <i>faery court</i> it did resound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where courteous knights and ladies most did won<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all on earth, and made a matchless paragon.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>For <i>Faery Court</i> means the <i>reign of Chivalry</i>;
which, it seems, had undergone a fatal
revolution before the age of <span class="smcap">Milton</span>, who tells
us that <i>Courtesy</i></p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&mdash;&mdash;is sooner found in lonely sheds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With smoaky rafters, than in tap’stry halls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And courts of princes, where it first was nam’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet is most pretended.<br /></span>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">Mask.</span><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Further, the free commerce of the ladies, in
those knots and circles of the great, would
operate so far on the sturdiest knights, as to
give birth to the attentions of gallantry. But
this gallantry would take a refined turn, not
only from the necessity there was of maintaining
the strict form of decorum, amidst a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
promiscuous conversation under the eye of the
Prince and in his own family; but also from
the inflamed sense they must needs have of
the frequent outrages committed, by their
neighbouring clans of adversaries, on the honour
of the sex, when by chance of war they
had fallen into their hands. Violations of
chastity being the most atrocious crimes they
had to charge on their enemies, they would
pride themselves in the merit of being its protectors:
and as this virtue was, of all others,
the fairest and strongest claim of the sex itself
to such protection, it is no wonder that the
notions of it were, in time, carried to so platonic
an elevation.</p>

<p>Thus, again, the great master of Chivalry
himself, on this subject,</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It hath been thro’ all ages ever seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That, with the praise of arms and chivalry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prize of beauty still hath joined been;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And that for reason’s special privity:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For either doth on other much rely;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For <span class="smcap">He</span> mee seems most fit the fair to serve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That can her best defend from villainy;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And <span class="smcap">She</span> most fit his service doth deserve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fairest is, and from her faith will never swerve.<br /></span>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">Spenser</span>, <small>B. IV. C.</small> v.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

<p>Not but the foundation of this refined gallantry
was laid in the ancient manners of the
<i>German</i> nations. <span class="smcap">C&aelig;sar</span> tells us how far they
carried their practice of chastity, which he
seems willing to account for on political principles.
However that be, their consideration
of the sex was prodigious, as we see in the
history of their irruptions into the Empire;
where among all their ravages and devastations
of other sorts, we find they generally abstained
from offering any violence to the honour of
the women.</p>

<p>IV. It only remains to account for that “character
of Religion,” which was so deeply imprinted
on the minds of all knights, and was
essential to their institution. We are even
told, that <i>the love of God and of the ladies</i>
went hand in hand, in the duties and ritual of
Chivalry.</p>

<p>Two reasons may be assigned for this singularity:</p>

<p>First, the superstition of the times, in which
Chivalry arose; which was so great, that no
institution of a public nature could have found
credit in the world, that was not consecrated
by the churchmen, and closely interwoven with
religion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span></p>

<p>Secondly, the condition of the Christian
states; which had been harassed by long wars,
and had but just recovered a breathing-time
from the brutal ravages of the <i>Saracen</i> armies.
The remembrance of what they had lately
suffered from these grand enemies of the faith,
made it natural, and even necessary, to engage
a new military order on the side of religion.</p>

<p>And how warmly this principle, <i>a zeal for
the faith</i>, was acted upon by the professors of
Chivalry, and how deeply it entered into their
ideas of the military character, we see from
the term so constantly used by the old Romancers,
of <span class="smcap">Recreant</span> [<i>i. e.</i> Apostate] Knight;
by which they meant to express, with the utmost
force, their disdain of a dastard or vanquished
knight. For, many of this order
falling into the hands of the <i>Saracens</i>, such of
them as had not imbibed the full spirit of their
profession, were induced to renounce their
faith, in order to regain their liberty. These
men, as sinning against the great fundamental
laws of Chivalry, they branded with this name;
a name of complicated reproach, which implied
a want of the two most essential qualities
of a Knight, <small>COURAGE</small> and <small>FAITH</small>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

<p>Hence too, the reason appears why the
<i>Spaniards</i>, of all the Europeans, were furthest
gone in every characteristic madness of true
chivalry. To all the other considerations,
here mentioned, their fanaticism in every way
was especially instigated and kept alive by the
memory and neighbourhood of their old infidel
invaders.</p>

<p>And thus we seem to have a fair account of
that <small>PROWESS</small>, <small>GENEROSITY</small>, <small>GALLANTRY</small>, and
<small>RELIGION</small>, which were the peculiar and vaunted
characteristics of the purer ages of Chivalry.</p>

<p>Such was the state of things in the Western
world, when the Crusades to the Holy Land
were set on foot. Whence we see how well
prepared the minds of men were for engaging in
that enterprize. Every object, that had entered
into the views of the institutors of Chivalry,
and had been followed by its professors,
was now at hand, to inflame the military and
religious ardor of the knights, to the utmost.
And here, in fact, we find the strongest and
boldest features of their genuine character:
<i>daring</i> to madness, in enterprises of hazard:
burning with zeal for the delivery of the <i>oppressed</i>;
and, which was deemed the height
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
of <i>religious</i> merit, for the rescue of the holy
city out of the hands of infidels; and, lastly,
exalting their honour of <i>chastity</i> so high
as to profess celibacy; as they constantly did,
in the several orders of knighthood created on
that extravagant occasion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

<h4 id="IV">LETTER IV.</h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">What</span> think you, my good friend, of this
learned deduction? Do not you begin to favour
my conjecture, as whimsical as it might
seem, of the <i>rise and genius</i> of Knight-errantry.</p>

<p>And yet (so slippery is the ground, on which
we system-makers stand) from what I observed
of the spirit, with which the Crusades were
carried on, a hint may be taken, which threatens
to overturn my whole system.</p>

<p>It is, “That, whereas I derive the Crusades
from the spirit of Chivalry, the circumstances
attending the progress of the Crusades,
and even as pointed out by myself, seem to
favour the opposite opinion of Chivalry’s
taking its rise from that enterprize.”</p>

<p>For thus the argument is drawn out by a
learned person<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>, to whom I communicated the
substance of my last Letter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span></p>

<p>“On the crumbling of the Western empire
into small states, with regular subordinations
of vassals and their chiefs, who looked up to a
common sovereign, it was soon found that
those chiefs had it in their power to make
themselves very formidable to their masters;
and, just in that crisis of European manners
and empire, the <i>Saracens</i> having expelled
Christianity from the East, the Western Princes
seized the opportunity, and with great
craft turned the warlike genius of their feudataries,
which would otherwise have preyed
upon themselves, into the spirit of Crusades
against the common enemy.</p>

<p>But when, now, the ardour of the Crusades
was abated in some sort, though not extinguished,
the <i>Gothic</i> princes and their families
had settled into established monarchies. Then
it was, that the restless spirit of their vassals,
having little employment abroad, and being
restrained in a good degree from exerting itself
with success in domestic quarrels, broke out in
all the extravagances of <small>KNIGHT-ERRANTRY</small>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>

<p>Military fame, acquired in the Holy land,
had entitled the adventurers to the <i>insignia</i> of
arms, the source of Heraldry; and inspired
them with the love of war and the passion of
enterprize. Their late expeditions had given
them a turn for roving in quest of adventures;
and their religious zeal had infused high notions
of piety, justice, and chastity.</p>

<p>The scene of action being now more confined,
they turned themselves, from <i>the world’s
debate</i>, to private and personal animosities.
Chivalry was employed in rescuing humble and
faithful vassals, from the oppression of petty
lords; their women, from savage lust; and the
hoary heads of hermits (a species of Eastern
monks, much reverenced in the Holy land),
from rapine and outrage.</p>

<p>In the mean time the courts of the feudal sovereigns
grew magnificent and polite; and, as
the military constitution still subsisted, military
merit was to be upheld; but, wanting its old
objects, it naturally softened into the fictitious
images and courtly exercises of war, in <i>justs
and tournaments</i>: where the honour of the
ladies supplied the place of zeal for the holy
Sepulchre; and thus the courtesy of elegant
love, but of a wild and fanatic species, as being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
engrafted on spiritual enthusiasm, came to
mix itself with the other characters of the
Knights-errant.”</p>

<p>In this way, you see, all the characteristics
of Chivalry, which I had derived from the
essential properties of the feudal government,
are made to result from the spirit of Crusades,
which with me was only an accidental effect of
it: and this deduction may be thought to agree
best with the representation of the old Romancers.</p>

<p>This hypothesis, so plausible in itself, is
very ingeniously supported. Yet I have something
to object to it; or rather, which flatters
me more, I think I can turn it to the advantage
of my own system.</p>

<p>For what if I allow (as indeed I needs must)
that <i>Chivalry</i>, such as we have it represented
in books of Romance, so much posterior to the
date of that military institution, took its colour
and character from the impressions made on
the minds of men by the spirit of crusading
into the Holy land? Still it may be true, that
Chivalry itself had, properly, another and an
earlier origin. And I must think it certainly
<i>had</i>, if for no other, yet, for this reason: that,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
unless the seeds of that spirit, which appeared
in the Crusades, had been plentifully sown and
indeed grown up into some maturity in the
feudal times preceding that event, I see not
how it could have been possible for the Western
princes to give that politic diversion to
their turbulent vassals, which the new hypothesis
supposes.</p>

<p>In short, there are <small>TWO DISTINCT PERIODS</small>
to be carefully observed, in a deduction of the
rise and progress of Chivalry.</p>

<p>The <small>FIRST</small> is that in which the empire was
overturned, and the feudal governments were
every where introduced on its ruins, by the
Northern nations. In this &aelig;ra, that new policy
settled itself in the West, and operated so
powerfully as to lay the first foundations, and
to furnish the remote causes, of what we know
by the name of Chivalry.</p>

<p>The <small>OTHER</small> period is, when these causes had
taken a fuller effect, and shewed themselves in
that signal enterprize of the Crusades; which
not only concurred with the spirit of Chivalry,
already pullulating in the minds of men, but
brought a prodigious encrease, and gave a singular
force and vigour, to all its operations. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
this &aelig;ra, Chivalry took deep root, and at the
same time shot up to its full height and size.
So that now it was in the state of <span class="smcap">Virgil’s</span>
Tree&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&mdash;Qu&aelig; quantum vertice ad auras<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&AElig;thereas, tantum radice in Tartara tendit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ergo non hiemes illam, non flabra, neque imbres<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Convellunt: immota manet, multosque per annos<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Multa vir&ucirc;m volvens durando s&aelig;cula vincit.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>From this last period, the Romancers, whether
in prose or verse, derive all their ideas of
Chivalry. It was <i>natural</i> for them to do so;
for they were best acquainted with that period:
and, besides, it suited their <i>design</i> best; for
the manners, they were to paint, were then
full formed, and so distinctly marked as fitted
them for the use of description.</p>

<p>But that the former period, notwithstanding,
really gave birth to this institution may be
gathered, not only from the reason of the
thing, but from the surer information of authentic
history. For there are traces of Chivalry,
in its most peculiar and characteristic
forms, to be found in the age preceding the
Crusades; and even justs and tournaments,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
the <i>image</i> of serious Knight-errantry, were
certainly of earlier date than that event, as I
had before occasion to observe to you.</p>

<p>Though I think, then, my notion <i>of the
rise of Chivalry</i> stands unimpaired, or rather
is somewhat illustrated and confirmed, by what
the excellent person has opposed to it, yet I
could not hold it fair to conceal so specious
and well supported an objection from you.
You are too generous to take advantage of the
arms I put into your hands; and are, besides,
so far from any thoughts of combating my system
itself, that your concern, it seems, is only
to know, where I learned the several particulars,
on which I have formed it.</p>

<p>You are willing, you say, to advance on
sure grounds; and therefore call upon me to
point out to you the authorities, from which I
pretend to have collected the several marks and
characteristics of true Chivalry.</p>

<p>Your request is reasonable; and I acknowledge
the omission, in not acquainting you that
my information was taken from its proper
source, the <i>old Romances</i>. Not that I shall
make a merit with you in having perused these
barbarous volumes myself; much less would I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
impose the ungrateful task upon you. Thanks
to the curiosity of certain painful collectors,
this knowledge may be obtained at a cheaper
rate. And I think it sufficient to refer you to
a learned and very elaborate memoir of a
<i>French</i> writer, who has put together all that is
requisite to be known on this subject. Materials
are first laid in, before the architect goes
to work; and if the structure, I am here raising
out of them, be to your mind, you will
not think the worse of it because I pretend not,
myself, to have worked in the quarry. In a
word, and to drop this magnificent allusion, if
I account to you for the rise and genius of
Chivalry, it is all you are to expect; for an
idea of what Chivalry was in itself, you may
have recourse to tom. xx. of the <i>Memoirs of
the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles
Lettres</i>.</p>

<p>And with this explanation I return, at length,
to my proper business.</p>

<p>Supposing my idea of Chivalry to be fairly
given, the conjecture I advance on the <i>origin
and nature</i> of it, you incline to think, may
deserve to be admitted. But you will, perhaps,
admit it the more readily, if you reflect,
“That there is a remarkable correspondency
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
between the manners of the old heroic times,
as painted by their great romancer, <span class="smcap">Homer</span>,
and those which are represented to us in
books of modern knight-errantry.” A fact,
of which no good account, I believe, can be
given but by the assistance of another, not less
certain, “That the political state of <i>Greece</i>, in
the earlier periods of its story, was similar in
many respects to that of <i>Europe</i>, as broken
by the feudal system into an infinite number
of petty independent governments.”</p>

<p>It is not my design to encroach on the province
of the learned person<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>, to whom I owe
this hint, and who hath undertaken, at his leisure,
to enlarge upon it. But some few circumstances
of agreement between the <i>Heroic</i>
and <i>Gothic</i> manners, such as are most obvious
and occur to my memory, while I am writing,
may be worth putting down, by way of specimen
only of what may be expected from a professed
inquiry into this curious subject.</p>

<p>And, <small>FIRST</small>, “the military enthusiasm of
the Barons is but of a piece with the fanaticism
of the Heroes.” Hence the same particularity
of description, in the account of battles,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
wounds, deaths, in the <i>Greek</i> poet, as in
the <i>Gothic</i> romancers: hence that perpetual
succession of combats and deeds of arms, even
to satiety, in the <i>Iliad</i>: and hence that minute
curiosity, in the display of the dresses, arms,
accoutrements of the combatants, which we
find so strange, in that poem. The minds of
all men being occupied and in a manner possessed
with warlike images and ideas, were
much gratified by the poet’s dwelling on the
very slightest circumstances of these things,
which now, for want of their prejudices, appear
cold and unaffecting to modern readers.</p>

<p>But the correspondency holds in more particular
considerations. For,</p>

<p>2. “We hear much of Knights-errant encountering
<i>Giants</i>, and quelling <i>Savages</i>, in
books of Chivalry.”</p>

<p>These Giants were oppressive feudal Lords;
and every Lord was to be met with, like the
Giant, in his strong hold, or castle. Their
dependants of a lower form, who imitated the
violence of their superiors, and had not their
castles, but their lurking-places, were the
Savages of Romance. The greater Lord was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
called a Giant, for his power; the less a Savage,
for his brutality.</p>

<p>All this is shadowed out in the <i>Gothic</i> tales,
and sometimes expressed in plain words. The
objects of the Knight’s vengeance go indeed by
the various names of Giants, Paynims, Saracens,
and Savages. But of what family they
all are, is clearly seen from the poet’s description:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What Mister wight, quoth he, and how far hence<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is he, that doth to travellers such harms?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is, said he, a man of great defence,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Expert in battle, and in deeds of arms;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And more embolden’d by the wicked charms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which his daughter doth him still support;<br /></span>

<span class="author"><span class="smcap">Spenser</span>, <small>B. V. C.</small> ii.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Here we have the great oppressive Baron
very graphically set forth: and the <i>Groom of
evil guise</i> is as plainly the Baron’s vassal. The
Romancers, we see, took no great liberty with
these respectable personages, when they called
the one a Giant, and the other a Savage.</p>

<p>“Another terror of the <i>Gothic</i> ages was,
<i>Monsters</i>, <i>Dragons</i>, and <i>Serpents</i>.” These
stories were received in those days for several
reasons: 1. From the vulgar belief of enchantments:
2. From their being reported, on the
faith of Eastern tradition, by the adventurers
into the Holy Land: 3. In still later times,
from the strange things told and believed, on
the discovery of the new world.</p>

<p>This last consideration we find employed
by <span class="smcap">Spenser</span> to give an air of probability to
his <i>Fairy Tales</i>, in the preface to his second
book.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span></p>

<p>Now in all these respects <i>Greek</i> antiquity
very much resembles the <i>Gothic</i>. For what
are <span class="smcap">Homer’s</span> <i>L&aelig;strigons</i> and <i>Cyclops</i>, but
bands of lawless savages, with, each of them,
a Giant of enormous size at their head? And
what are the <i>Grecian</i> <span class="smcap">Bacchus</span> and <span class="smcap">Hercules</span>,
but Knights-errant, the exact counter-parts of
Sir <span class="smcap">Launcelot</span> and <span class="smcap">Amadis de Gaule</span>?</p>

<p>For this interpretation we have the authority
of our great poet:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such first was <span class="smcap">Bacchus</span>, that with furious might<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All th’ East, before untam’d, did overcome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wrong repressed and establish’d right,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which lawless men had formerly fordonne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next <span class="smcap">Hercules</span> his like ensample shew’d,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The club of justice drad, with kingly pow’r endu’d.<br /></span>
<span class="author"><small>B. V. C.</small> i.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Even <span class="smcap">Plutarch’s</span> life of <span class="smcap">Theseus</span> reads,
throughout, like a modern Romance: and Sir
<span class="smcap">Arthegal</span> himself is hardly his fellow, for
righting wrongs and redressing grievances. So
that <span class="smcap">Euripides</span> might well make him say of
himself, <i>that he had chosen the profession and</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
<i>calling of a Knight-errant</i>: for this is the
sense, and almost the literal construction, of
the following verses:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ἔθος τόδ’ εἰς Ἕλληνας ἐξελεξάμην<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ἀεὶ ΚΟΛΑΣΤΗΣ ΤΩΝ ΚΑΚΩΝ καθεστάναι.<br /></span>
<span class="author">Ἱκέτιδες, ver. 340.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Accordingly, <span class="smcap">Theseus</span> is a favourite Hero (witness
the <i>Knight’s Tale</i> in <span class="smcap">Chaucer</span>) even with
the Romance-writers.</p>

<p>Nay, could the very castle of a <i>Gothic</i> giant
be better described than in the words of <span class="smcap">Homer</span>,</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">High walls and battlements the courts inclose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the strong gates defy a host of foes.<br /></span>
<span class="author">Od. <small>B. XVII.</small> ver. 318.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And do not you remember that the <i>Grecian</i>
Worthies were, in their day, as famous for
encountering Dragons and quelling Monsters
of all sorts, as for suppressing Giants?</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;per hos cecidere just&acirc;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Morte Centauri, cecidit tremend&aelig;<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Flamma Chim&aelig;r&aelig;.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>3. “The oppressions, which it was the glory
of the Knight to avenge, were frequently carried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
on, as we are told, <i>by the charms and enchantments
of women</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> <i>charms</i>, we may suppose, are often
metaphorical; as expressing only the blandishments
of the sex, by which they either
seconded the designs of their Lords, or were
enabled to carry on designs for themselves.
Sometimes they are taken to be real; the ignorance
of those ages acquiescing in such conceits.</p>

<p>And are not these stories matched by those
of <i>Calypso</i> and <i>Circe</i>, the enchantresses of the
<i>Greek</i> poet?</p>

<p>Still there are conformities more directly to
our purpose.</p>

<p>4. “Robbery and piracy were honourable in
both; so far were they from reflecting any discredit
on the ancient or modern <i>redressers of
wrongs</i>.”</p>

<p>What account can be given of this odd circumstance,
but that, in the feudal times and
in the early days of <i>Greece</i>, when government
was weak, and unable to redress the frequent
injuries of petty sovereigns, it would be glorious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
for private adventurers to undertake this
work; and, if they could accomplish it in no
other way, to pay them in kind by downright
plunder and rapine?</p>

<p>This, in effect, is the account given us, of
the same disposition of the old <i>Germans</i>, by
<span class="smcap">C&aelig;sar</span>: “Latrocinia,” says he, “nullam habent
infamiam, qu&aelig; extra fines cujusque civitatis
fiunt.” And the reason appears from
what he had just told us&mdash;“in pace, nullus est
communis magistratus; sed principes regionum
atque pagorum inter suos jus dicunt, controversiasque
minuunt.” <i>De Bello Gall.</i> l. vi.
&sect; 21.</p>

<p>5. Their manners, in another respect, were
the same. “Bastardy was in credit with both.”
They were extremely watchful over the chastity
of their own women; but such as they could
seize upon in the enemy’s quarter were lawful
prize. Or, if at any time they transgressed in
this sort at home, the heroic ages were complaisant
enough to cover the fault by an ingenious
fiction. The offspring was reputed divine.</p>

<p>Nay, so far did they carry their indulgence to
this commerce, that their greatest Heroes were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
the fruit of Goddesses approached by mortals;
just as we hear of the doughtiest Knights being
born of Fairies.</p>

<p>6. Is it not strange, that, together with the
greatest fierceness and savageness of character,
“the utmost generosity, hospitality, and courtesy,
should be imputed to the heroic ages?”
<span class="smcap">Achilles</span> was at once the most relentless, vindictive,
implacable, and the friendliest of men.</p>

<p>We have the very same representation in
the <i>Gothic</i> Romances, where it is almost true
what <span class="smcap">Butler</span> says humorously of these benign
heroes, that</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They did in fight but cut work out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">T’ employ their courtesies about.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>How are these contradictions, in the characters
of the ancient and modern men of arms,
to be reconciled, but by observing that, as in
those lawless times dangers and distresses of all
sorts abounded, there would be the same demand
for compassion, gentleness, and generous
attachments to the unfortunate, those especially
of their own clan, as of resentment, rage,
and animosity against their enemies?</p>

<p>7. Again: consider the martial <i>Games</i>,
which ancient <i>Greece</i> delighted to celebrate on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
great and solemn occasions: and see if they
had not the same origin, and the same purpose,
as the <i>Tournaments</i> of the <i>Gothic</i> warriors.</p>

<p>8. Lastly, “the passion for adventures, so
natural in their situation, would be as naturally
attended with the love of praise and glory.”</p>

<p>Hence the same encouragement, in the old
<i>Greek</i> and <i>Gothic</i> times, to panegyrists and
poets; the <span class="smcap">Bards</span> being as welcome to the
tables of the feudal Lords, as the ΑΟΙΔΟΙ of
old, to those of the <i>Grecian</i> Heroes.</p>

<p>And, as the same causes ever produce the
same effects, we find that, even so late as <span class="smcap">Elizabeth’s</span>
reign, the savage <i>Irish</i> (who were
much in the state of the ancient <i>Greeks</i>, living
under the anarchy, rather than government,
of their numberless puny chiefs) had their
Rhymers in principal estimation. It was for
the reason just given, for the honour of their
panegyrics on their fierce adventures and successes.
And thus it was in <i>Greece</i>:</p>

<h4 id="V">LETTER V.</h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> purpose of the casual hints, suggested
in my last letter, was only to shew that the resemblance
between the Heroic and <i>Gothic</i> ages
is great: so great that the observation of it did
not escape the old Romancers themselves, <i>with
whom</i>, as an ingenious critic observes, <i>the siege
of <span class="smcap">Thebes</span> and <span class="smcap">Trojan war</span> were favourite
stories; the characters and incidents of which
they were mixing perpetually with their Romances</i><a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>.
And to this persuasion and practice
of the Romance-writers <span class="smcap">Cervantes</span> plainly alludes,
when he makes Don <span class="smcap">Quixote</span> say&mdash;&mdash;<i>If
the stories of Chivalry be lies, so must it
also be, that there ever was a <span class="smcap">Hector</span>, or an
<span class="smcap">Achilles</span>, or a <span class="smcap">Trojan war</span></i><a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>&mdash;a sly stroke
of satire, by which this mortal foe of Chivalry
would, I suppose, insinuate that the <i>Grecian</i>
Romances were just as extravagant and as little
credible, as the <i>Gothic</i>. Or, whatever his
purpose might be, the resemblance between
them, you see, is confessed, and hath now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
been shewn in so many instances that there
will hardly be any doubt of it. And though
you say true, that ignorance and barbarity itself
might account for some circumstances of
this resemblance; yet the parallel would hardly
have held so long, and run so closely, if the
<i>civil</i> condition of both had not been much the
same.</p>

<p>So that when we see a sort of Chivalry,
springing up among the <i>Greeks</i>, who were
confessedly in a state resembling that of the
feudal barons, and attended by the like symptoms
and effects, is it not fair to conclude that
the Chivalry of the <i>Gothic</i> times was owing to
that common corresponding <i>state</i>, and received
its character from it?</p>

<p>And this circumstance, by the way, accounts
for the constant mixture, which the modern
critic esteems so monstrous, of Pagan fable
with the fairy tales of Romance. The passion
for ancient learning, just then revived, might
seduce the classic poets, such as <span class="smcap">Spenser</span> and
<span class="smcap">Tasso</span> for instance, into this practice; but the
similar turn and genius of ancient manners,
and of the fictions founded upon them, would
make it appear easy and natural in all.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>

<p>I am aware, as you object to me, that, in
the affair of <i>religion</i> and <i>gallantry</i>, the resemblance
between the Hero and Knight is not
so striking.</p>

<p>But the religious character of the Knight
was an accident of the times, and no proper
effect of his <i>civil</i> condition.</p>

<p>And that his devotion for the sex should so
far surpass that of the Hero, is a fresh confirmation
of my system.</p>

<p>For, though much, no doubt, might be
owing to the different humour and genius of
the East and West, antecedent to any customs
and forms of government, and independent of
them; yet the consideration had of the females
in the feudal constitution will, of itself, account
for this difference. It made them capable
of succeeding to fiefs as well as the men.
And does not one see, on the instant, what respect
and dependence this privilege would draw
upon them?</p>

<p>It was of mighty consequence who should
obtain the grace of a rich heiress. And though,
in the strict feudal times, she was supposed to
be in the power and disposal of her superior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
Lord, yet this rigid state of things did not last
long; and, while it did last, could not abate
much of the homage that would be paid to the
fair feudatary.</p>

<p>Thus, when interest had begun the habit,
the language of love and flattery would soon do
the rest. And to what that language tended,
you may see by the constant strain of the Romances
themselves. Some distressed damsel
was the spring and mover of every Knight’s
adventure. She was to be rescued by his arms,
or won by the fame and admiration of his
prowess.</p>

<p>The plain meaning of all which was this:
that, as in those turbulent feudal times a protector
was necessary to the weakness of the sex,
so the courteous and valorous knight was to
approve himself fully qualified for that office.
And we find, he had other motives to set him
on work than the mere charms and graces,
though ever so bewitching, of the person addressed.</p>

<p>Hence then, as I suppose, the custom was
introduced: and, when introduced, you will
hardly wonder it should operate much longer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
and further than the reason may seem to require,
on which it was founded.</p>

<p>If you still insist that I carry this matter too
far, and that, in fact, the introduction of the
female succession into fiefs was too late to
justify me in accounting for the rise of feudal
gallantry from that circumstance; you will
only teach me to frame my answer in a more
accurate manner.</p>

<p>First then, I shall confess that the way to
avoid all confusion on this subject would be, to
distinguish carefully between the state of things
in the <i>early</i> feudal times, and that in the <i>later</i>,
when the genius of the feudal law was much
changed and corrupted; and that, whoever
would go to the bottom of this affair, should
keep a constant eye on this reasonable distinction.</p>

<p>But then, <i>secondly</i>, I may observe that this
distinction is the less necessary to be attended
to in the present case, because the law of female
succession, whenever it was introduced,
had certainly taken place long before the Romancers
wrote, from whom we derive all our
ideas of the feudal gallantry. So that, if you
take their word for the gallantry of those times,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
you may very consistently, if you please, accept
my account of it. For it is but supposing
that the feudal gallantry, such as they paint it,
was the offspring of that privilege, such as they
saw the ladies then possess, of feudal succession.
And the connexion between these two
things is so close and so natural, that we cannot
be much mistaken in deducing the one from
the other.</p>

<p>In conclusion of this topic, I must just observe
to you, that the two poems of <span class="smcap">Homer</span>
express in the liveliest manner, and were intended
to expose, the capital mischiefs and inconveniencies
arising from the <i>political state</i>
of old <i>Greece</i>; the <i>Iliad</i>, the dissensions that
naturally spring up amongst a number of independent
chiefs; and the <i>Odyssey</i>, the insolence
of their greater subjects, more especially
when unrestrained by the presence of their sovereign.</p>

<p>These were the subjects of his pen. And
can any thing more exactly resemble the condition
of the <i>feudal times</i>, when, on occasion
of any great enterprise, as that of the Crusades,
the designs of the confederate Christian states
were perpetually frustrated, or interrupted at
least, by the dissensions of their leaders; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
their affairs at home as perpetually distressed
and disordered by domestic licence, and the
rebellious usurpations of their greater vassals?</p>

<p>It is true, as to the charge of <i>domestic licence</i>,
so exactly does the parallel run between
old <i>Greece</i> and old <i>England</i>, I find one exception
to it, in each country: and that <i>one</i>,
a Romance-critic would shew himself very uncourteous,
if he did not take a pleasure to celebrate.
<span class="smcap">Guy</span>, the renowned earl of <i>Warwick</i>,
old stories say, returned from the holy wars to
his lady in the disguise of a pilgrim or beggar,
as <span class="smcap">Ulysses</span> did to <span class="smcap">Penelope</span>. What the suspicions
were of the Knight and the Hero, the
contrivance itself but too plainly declares. But
their fears were groundless in both cases. Only
the Knight seems to have had the advantage of
the Prince of <span class="smcap">Ithaca</span>: for, instead of rioting
suitors to drive out of his castle, he had only
to contemplate his good lady in the peaceful
and pious office of <i>distributing daily alms to
<small>XIII</small> poor men</i>.</p>

<p>No conclusion, however, is to be drawn
from a single instance; and, in general, it is
said, the adventurers into the Holy Land could
no more depend on the fidelity of their spouses,
than of their vassals. So that, in all respects,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
<i>Jerusalem</i> was to the <i>European</i>, what <i>Troy</i>
had been to the <i>Grecian</i> heroes. And, though
the <i>Odyssey</i> found no rival among the <i>Gothic</i>
poems, you will think it natural enough from
these corresponding circumstances, that <span class="smcap">Tasso’s</span>
immortal work should be planned upon the
model of the <i>Iliad</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>

<h4 id="VI">LETTER VI.</h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Let</span> it be no surprise to you that, in the
close of my last Letter, I presumed to bring
the <i>Gierusalemme liberata</i> into competition
with the <i>Iliad</i>.</p>

<p>So far as the heroic and <i>Gothic</i> manners are
the same, the pictures of each, if well taken,
must be equally entertaining. But I go further,
and maintain that the circumstances, in
which they differ, are clearly to the advantage
of the <i>Gothic</i> designers.</p>

<p>You see, my purpose is to lead you from
this forgotten Chivalry to a more amusing subject;
I mean, the <i>Poetry</i> we still read, though
it was founded upon it.</p>

<p>Much has been said, and with great truth,
of the felicity of <span class="smcap">Homer’s</span> age, for poetical
manners. But, as <span class="smcap">Homer</span> was a citizen of the
world, when he had seen in <i>Greece</i>, on the
one hand, the manners he has described, could
he, on the other hand, have seen in the West
the manners of the feudal ages, I make no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
doubt but he would certainly have preferred
the latter. And the grounds of this preference
would, I suppose, have been, “<i>the improved
gallantry of the Gothic knights</i>; and the
<i>superior solemnity of their superstitions</i>.”</p>

<p>If any great poet, like <span class="smcap">Homer</span>, had flourished
in these times, and given the feudal
manners from the <i>life</i> (for, after all, <span class="smcap">Spenser</span>
and <span class="smcap">Tasso</span> came too late, and it was impossible
for them to paint truly and perfectly what
was no longer seen or believed); this preference,
I persuade myself, had been very sensible.
But their fortune was not so happy:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&mdash;&mdash;omnes illacrymabiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urgentur, ignotique long&acirc;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nocte, carent quia vate sacro.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>As it is, we may take a guess of what the
subject was capable of affording to real genius,
from the rude sketches we have of it in the old
Romancers. And it is but looking into any of
them to be convinced, that the <span class="smcap">Gallantry</span>,
which inspired the feudal times, was of a
nature to furnish the poet with finer scenes
and subjects of description in every view, than
the simple and uncontrolled barbarity of the
<i>Grecian</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>

<p>The principal entertainment arising from the
delineation of these consists in the exercise of
the boisterous passions, which are provoked
and kept alive, from one end of the <i>Iliad</i> to
the other, by every imaginable scene of rage,
revenge, and slaughter. In the other, together
with these, the gentler and more humane
affections are awakened in us by the most interesting
displays of love and friendship; of
love, elevated to its noblest heights; and of
friendship, operating on the purest motives.
The mere variety of these paintings is a relief
to the reader, as well as writer. But their
beauty, novelty, and pathos, give them a vast
advantage, on the comparison.</p>

<p>So that, on the whole, though the spirit,
passions, rapine, and violence, of the two sets
of manners were equal, yet there was an elegance,
a variety, a dignity in the feudal, which
the other wanted.</p>

<p>As to <small>RELIGIOUS MACHINERY</small>, perhaps the
popular system of each was equally remote
from reason; yet the latter had something in
it more amusing, as well as more awakening to
the imagination.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span></p>

<p>The current popular tales of Elves and
Fairies were even fitter to take the credulous
mind, and charm it into a willing admiration
of the <i>specious miracles</i> which wayward fancy
delights in, than those of the old traditionary
rabble of Pagan divinities. And then, for the
more solemn fancies of witchcraft and incantation,
the <i>Gothic</i> are above measure striking
and terrible.</p>

<p>You will tell me, perhaps, that these fancies,
as terrible as they were, are but of a piece with
those of Pagan superstition; and that nothing
can exceed what the classic writers have related
or feigned of its magic and necromantic horrors.</p>

<p>To spare you the trouble of mustering up
against me all that your extensive knowledge
of antiquity would furnish, let me confess to
you that many of the ancient poets have occasionally
adorned this theme. If, among twenty
others, I select only the names of <span class="smcap">Ovid</span>, <span class="smcap">Seneca</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Lucan</span>, it is, because these writers,
by the character of their genius, were best
qualified for the task, and have, besides, exerted
their whole strength upon it. <span class="smcap">Lucan</span>,
especially, has drawn out all the pomp of his
eloquence in celebrating those <span class="smcap">Thessalian
Charms</span>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span></p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">ficti quas nulla licentia monstri<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transierat, quarum, quicquid non creditur, ars est.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Yet <small>STILL</small> I pretend to shew you that all his
prodigies, fall short of the <i>Gothic</i>: and you
will come the less reluctantly into my sentiments,
if you reflect, “<span class="smcap">That</span> the thick and
troubled stream of superstition, which flowed
so plentifully in the classic ages, has been constantly
deepening and darkening by the confluence
of those supplies, which ignorance and
corrupted religion have poured in upon it.”</p>

<p>First, you will call to mind that all the
gloomy visions of d&aelig;mons and spirits, which
sprung out of the Alexandrian or Platonic philosophy,
were in the later ages of Paganism
engrafted on the old stock of classic superstition.
These portentous dreams, <i>new hatched
to the woful time</i>, as <span class="smcap">Shakespear</span> speaks, enabled
<span class="smcap">Apuleius</span> to outdo <span class="smcap">Lucan</span> himself, in
some of his magic scenes and exhibitions.</p>

<p>Next, you will observe that a fresh and exhaustless
swarm of the direst superstitions took
their birth in the frozen regions of the North,
and were naturally enough conceived in the
imaginations of a people involved in tenfold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
darkness; I mean, in the thickest shades of
ignorance, as well as in the gloom of their
comfortless woods and forests. I call these the
<i>direst superstitions</i>; for though the South and
East may have produced some that shew more
wild and fantastic, yet those of the North have
ever been of a more sombrous and horrid aspect,
agreeably to the singular circumstances and
situation of that savage and benighted people.</p>

<p>These dismal fancies, which the barbarians
carried out with them in their migrations into
the North-west, took the readier and the faster
hold of men’s minds, from the kindred darkness
into which the Western world was then
fallen, and from the desolation (so apt to engender
all fearful conceits and apprehensions)
which every where attended the incursions of
those ravagers.</p>

<p>Lastly, before the Romancers applied themselves
to dress up these dreadful stories, Christian
superstition had grown to its height, and
had transferred on the magic system all its additional
and supernumerary horrors.</p>

<p>Taking, now, the whole together, you will
clearly see what we are to conclude of the
<i>Gothic</i> system of prodigy and enchantment;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
which was not so  properly  a single system, as
the aggregate,</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&mdash;of all that nature breeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perverse; all monstrous, all prodigious things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which fables yet had feign’d or fear conceiv’d.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>For, to the frightful forms of ancient necromancy
(which easily travelled down to us, when
the fairer offspring of pagan invention lost its
way, or was swallowed up in the general darkness
of the barbarous ages) were now joined the
hideous phantasms which had terrified the
Northern nations; and, to complete the horrid
groupe, with these were incorporated the
still more tremendous spectres of Christian superstition.</p>

<p>In this state of things, as I said, the Romancers
went to work; and with these multiplied
images of terror on their minds, you will
conclude, without being at the pains to form
particular comparisons, that they must manage
ill indeed, not to surpass, in this walk of magical
incantation, the original classic fablers.</p>

<p>But, if you require a comparison, I can tell
you where it is to be made, with much ease,
and to great advantage: I mean, in <span class="smcap">Shakespear’s</span>
<i>Macbeth</i>, where you will find (as his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
best critic observes) “the <i>Danish</i> or <i>Northern</i>,
intermixed with the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Roman</i> enchantments;
and all these worked up together
with a sufficient quantity of our own
country superstitions. So that <span class="smcap">Shakespear’s</span>
<i>Witch-Scenes</i> (as the same writer adds) are
like the <i>charms</i> they prepare in one of them:
where the ingredients are gathered from every
thing shocking in the <i>natural</i> world; as
here, from every thing absurd in the <i>moral</i>.”</p>

<p>Or, if you suspect this instance, as deriving
somewhat of its force and plausibility from the
<i>magic</i> hand of this critic, you may turn to
another in a great poet of that time; who has
been at the pains to make the comparison himself,
and whose word, as he gives it in honest
prose, may surely be taken.</p>

<p>In a work of <span class="smcap">B. Jonson</span>, which he calls
<span class="smcap">The Masque of Queens</span>, there are some
Witch-scenes; written with singular care, and
in emulation, as it may seem, of <span class="smcap">Shakespear’s</span>;
but certainly with the view (for so he tells us
himself) <i>of reconciling the practice of antiquity
to the neoteric, and making it familiar
with our popular witchcraft</i>.</p>

<p>This Masque is accompanied with notes of
the learned author, who had rifled all the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
stores of ancient and modern <i>D&aelig;monomagy</i>,
to furnish out his entertainment; and who
takes care to inform us, under each head,
whence he had fetched the ingredients, out of
which it is compounded.</p>

<p>In this elaborate work of <span class="smcap">Jonson</span> you have,
then, an easy opportunity of comparing the
ancient with the modern magic. And though,
as he was an idolater of the ancients, you will
expect him to draw freely from that source,
yet from the large use he makes, too, of his
other more recent authorities, you will perceive
that some of the darkest shades of his
picture are owing to hints and circumstances
which he had catched, and could only catch,
from the <i>Gothic</i> enchantments. Even such of
these circumstances, as, taken by themselves,
seem of less moment, should not be overlooked,
since (as the poet well observes of them)
<i>though they be but minutes in ceremony, yet
they make the act more dark and full of
horror</i>.</p>

<p>Thus <small>MUCH</small>, then, may serve for a cast of
<span class="smcap">Shakespear’s</span> and <span class="smcap">Jonson’s</span> magic: abundantly
sufficient, I must think, to convince
you of the superiority of the <i>Gothic</i> charms
and incantations, to the classic.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

<p>Though, after all, the conclusion is not to
be drawn so much from particular passages, as
from the <i>general impression</i> left on our minds,
in reading the ancient and modern poets.  And
this is so much in favour of the <i>latter</i>, that
Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span> scruples not to say, “The ancients
have not much of this poetry among
them; for indeed (continues he) almost the
whole substance of it owes its original to the
darkness and superstition of later ages&mdash;Our
forefathers looked upon nature with more
reverence and horror, before the world was
enlightened by learning and philosophy; and
loved to astonish themselves with the apprehensions
of witchcraft, prodigies, charms,
and inchantments. There was not a village
in <i>England</i>, that had not a ghost in it; the
church-yards were all haunted; every large
common had a circle of fairies belonging to
it; and there was scarce a shepherd to be
met with, who had not seen a spirit.”</p>

<p>We are upon enchanted ground, my friend;
and you are to think yourself well used, that
I detain you no longer in this fearful circle.
The glympse, you have had of it, will help
your imagination to conceive the rest. And
without more words you will readily apprehend
that the fancies of our modern bards are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
not only more gallant, but, on a change of
the scene, more sublime, more terrible, more
alarming, than those of the classic fablers.  In
a word, you will find that the <i>manners</i> they
paint, and the <i>superstitions</i> they adopt, are
the more poetical for being <i>Gothic</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span></p>

<h4 id="VII">LETTER VII.</h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">But</span> nothing shews the difference of the two
systems under consideration more plainly,
than the effect they really had on the Two
greatest of our Poets; at least the two which
an <i>English</i> reader is most fond to compare
with <span class="smcap">Homer</span>; I mean, <span class="smcap">Spenser</span> and <span class="smcap">Milton</span>.</p>

<p>It is not to be doubted but that each of
these bards had kindled his poetic fire from
classic fables. So that, of course, their prejudices
would lie that way. Yet they both
appear, when most inflamed, to have been
more particularly rapt with the <i>Gothic</i> fables
of Chivalry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spenser</span>, though he had been long nourished
with the spirit and substance of <span class="smcap">Homer</span>
and <span class="smcap">Virgil</span>, chose the times of Chivalry for
his theme, and Fairy Land for the scene of
his fictions. He could have planned, no
doubt, an heroic design on the exact classic
model: or, he might have trimmed between
the <i>Gothic</i> and classic, as his contemporary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
<span class="smcap">Tasso</span> did. But the charms of <i>fairy</i> prevailed.
And if any think, he was seduced by <span class="smcap">Ariosto</span>
into this choice, they should consider that it
could be only for the sake of his subject; for
the genius and character of these poets was
widely different.</p>

<p>Under this idea then of a <i>Gothic</i>, not classical
poem, the <i>Fairy Queen</i> is to be read and
criticized. And on these principles it would
not be difficult to unfold its merit in another
way than has been hitherto attempted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Milton</span>, it is true, preferred the classic model
to the <i>Gothic</i>. But it was after long hesitation;
and his favourite subject was <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>
<i>and his Knights of the round table</i>. On this
he had fixed for the greater part of his life.
What led him to change his mind was, partly,
as I suppose, his growing fondness for religious
subjects; partly, his ambition to take a different
rout from <span class="smcap">Spenser</span>; but chiefly perhaps,
the discredit into which the stories of
Chivalry had now fallen by the immortal satire
of <span class="smcap">Cervantes</span>. Yet we see through all his
poetry, where his enthusiasm flames out most,
a certain predilection for the legends of Chivalry
before the fables of <i>Greece</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span></p>

<p>This circumstance, you know, has given
offence to the austerer and more mechanical
critics. They are ready to censure his judgment,
as juvenile and unformed, when they
see him so delighted, on all occasions, with
the <i>Gothic</i> romances. But do these censors
imagine that <span class="smcap">Milton</span> did not perceive the defects
of these works, as well as they? No: it
was not the <i>composition</i> of books of Chivalry,
but the <i>manners</i> described in them, that took
his fancy; as appears from his <i>Allegro</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Towred cities please us then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the busy hum of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where throngs of knights and barons bold<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With store of ladies, whose bright eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rain influence, and judge the prize<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wit, or arms, while both contend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win her grace, whom all commend.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And when in the <i>Penseroso</i> he draws, by a
fine contrivance, the same kind of image to
sooth melancholy which he had before given
to excite mirth, he indeed extols an <i>author</i>,
or two, of these romances, as he had before,
in general, extolled the <i>subject</i> of them: but
they are authors worthy of his praise; not the
writers of <i>Amadis</i>, and <i>Sir Launcelot of the</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
<i>Lake</i>; but Fairy <span class="smcap">Spenser</span>, and <span class="smcap">Chaucer</span>
himself, who has left an unfinished story on
the <i>Gothic</i> or feudal model.</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Or, call up him that left half-told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The story of <span class="smcap">Cambuscan</span> bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of <span class="smcap">Camball</span> and of <span class="smcap">Algarsiff</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who had <span class="smcap">Canace</span> to wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That own’d the virtuous ring and glass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of the wondrous horse of brass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which the Tartar king did ride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if aught else great bards beside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sage and solemn tunes have sung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of turneys and of trophies hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of forests and inchantments drear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where more is meant than meets the ear.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The conduct then of these two poets may
incline us to think with more respect, than is
commonly done, of the <i>Gothic manners</i>; I
mean, as adapted to the uses of the greater
poetry.</p>

<p>I shall add nothing to what I before observed
of <span class="smcap">Shakespear</span>, because the sublimity
(the divinity, let it be, if nothing else
will serve) of his genius kept no certain rout,
but rambled at hazard into all the regions of
human life and manners. So that we can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
hardly say what he preferred, or what he rejected,
on full deliberation. Yet one thing is
clear, that even he is greater when he uses
<i>Gothic</i> manners and machinery, than when he
employs classical: which brings us again to
the same point, that the former have, by their
nature and genius, the advantage of the latter
in producing the <i>sublime</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span></p>

<h4 id="VIII">LETTER VIII.</h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">I&nbsp;spoke</span> “of criticizing <span class="smcap">Spenser’s</span> poem
under the idea, not of a classical, but <i>Gothic</i>
composition.”</p>

<p>It is certain, much light might be thrown
on that singular work, were an able critic to
consider it in this view. For instance, he
might go some way towards explaining, perhaps
justifying, the general plan and <i>conduct</i>
of the <i>Fairy Queen</i>, which, to classical readers,
has appeared indefensible.</p>

<p>I have taken the fancy, with your leave, to
try my hand on this curious subject.</p>

<p>When an architect examines a <i>Gothic</i> structure
by <i>Grecian</i> rules, he finds nothing but
deformity. But the <i>Gothic</i> architecture has
its own rules, by which when it comes to be
examined, it is seen to have its merit, as well
as the <i>Grecian</i>. The question is not, which
of the two is conducted in the simplest or truest
taste: but whether there be not sense and design
in both, when scrutinized by the laws on
which each is projected.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span></p>

<p>The same observation holds of the two
sorts of poetry. Judge of the <i>Fairy Queen</i>
by the classic models, and you are shocked
with its disorder: consider it with an eye to its
<i>Gothic</i> original, and you find it regular. The
unity and simplicity of the former are more
complete: but the latter has that sort of unity
and simplicity, which results from its nature.</p>

<p>The <i>Fairy Queen</i> then, as a <i>Gothic</i> poem,
derives its <small>METHOD</small>, as well as the other characters
of its composition, from the established
modes and ideas of Chivalry.</p>

<p>It was usual, in the days of knight-errantry,
at the holding of any great feast, for knights
to appear before the prince, who presided at
it, and claim the privilege of being sent on
any adventure to which the solemnity might
give occasion. For it was supposed that,
when such a <i>throng of knights and barons
bold</i>, as <span class="smcap">Milton</span> speaks of, were got together,
the distressed would flock in from all quarters,
as to a place where they knew they might find
and claim redress for all their grievances.</p>

<p>This was the real practice, in the days of
pure and ancient Chivalry. And an image
of this practice was afterwards kept up in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
castles of the great, on any extraordinary festival
or solemnity: of which, if you want an instance,
I refer you to the description of a feast
made at <i>Lisle</i> in 1453, in the court of <span class="smcap">Philip</span>
the good, duke of <i>Burgundy</i>, for a Crusade
against the <i>Turks</i>: as you may find it given
at large in the memoirs of <span class="smcap">Matthieu de Conci</span>,
<span class="smcap">Olivier de la Marche</span>, and <span class="smcap">Monstrelet</span>.</p>

<p>That feast was held for <i>twelve</i> days: and
each day was distinguished by the claim and
allowance of some adventure.</p>

<p>Now, laying down this practice as a foundation
for the poet’s design, you will see how
properly the <i>Fairy Queen</i> is conducted.</p>

<p>----“<span class="smcap">I devise</span>,” says the poet himself in
his letter to Sir <span class="smcap">W. Raleigh</span>, “that the <i>Fairy
Queen</i> kept her annual feaste xii days: upon
which xii several days, the occasions of the
xii several adventures happened; which
being undertaken by xii several knights, are
in these xii books severally handled.”</p>

<p>Here you have the poet delivering his own
method, and the reason of it. It arose out of
the order of his subject. And would you desire
a better reason for his choice?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span></p>

<p>Yes; you will say, a poet’s method is not
that of his subject.  I grant you, as to the order
of <i>time</i>, in which the recital is made; for
here, as <span class="smcap">Spenser</span> observes (and his own practice
agrees to the rule), lies the main difference
between <i>the poet historical, and the historiographer</i>:
the reason of which is drawn from
the nature of <i>Epic</i> composition itself, and
holds equally let the subject be what it will,
and whatever the system of manners be, on
which it is conducted. Gothic or Classic
makes no difference in this respect.</p>

<p>But the case is not the same with regard to
the general plan of a work, or what may be
called the order of <i>distribution</i>, which is and
must be governed by the subject-matter itself.
It was as requisite for the <i>Fairy Queen</i> to consist
of the adventures of twelve Knights, as for
the <i>Odyssey</i> to be confined to the adventures
of one Hero: justice had otherwise not been
done to his subject.</p>

<p>So that if you will say any thing against the
poet’s method, you must say that he should
not have chosen this subject. But this objection
arises from your classic ideas of Unity,
which have no place here; and are in every
view foreign to the purpose, if the poet has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
found means to give his work, though consisting
of many parts, the advantage of Unity.
For in some reasonable sense or other, it is
agreed, every work of art must be <i>one</i>, the
very idea of a work requiring it.</p>

<p>If you ask then, what is this <i>Unity</i> of <span class="smcap">Spenser’s</span>
Poem? I say, It consists in the relation
of its several adventures to one common <i>original</i>,
the appointment of the <i>Fairy Queen</i>;
and to one common <i>end</i>, the completion of
the <i>Fairy Queen’s</i> injunctions. The knights
issued forth on their adventures on the breaking
up of this annual feast: and the next annual
feast, we are to suppose, is to bring them
together again from the atchievement of their
several charges.</p>

<p>This, it is true, is not the classic Unity,
which consists in the representation of one
entire action: but it is an Unity of another
sort, an unity resulting from the respect which
a number of related actions have to one common
purpose. In other words, it is an unity
of <i>design</i>, and not of action.</p>

<p>This <i>Gothic</i> method of design in poetry
may be, in some sort, illustrated by what is
called the <i>Gothic</i> method of design in gardening.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
A wood or grove cut out into many
separate avenues or glades was among the most
favourite of the works of art, which our fathers
attempted in this species of cultivation. These
walks were distinct from each other, had each
their several destination, and terminated on
their own proper objects. Yet the whole was
brought together and considered under one
view, by the relation which these various
openings had, not to each other, but to their
common and concurrent center. You and I
are, perhaps, agreed that this sort of gardening
is not of so true a taste as that which <i>Kent
and Nature</i> have brought us acquainted with;
where the supreme art of the designer consists
in disposing his ground and objects into an
<i>entire landskip</i>; and grouping them, if I may
use the term, in so easy a manner, that the
careless observer, though he be taken with the
symmetry of the whole, discovers no art in the
combination:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In lieto aspetto il bel giardin s’aperse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acque stagnanti, mobili cristalli,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fior vari, e varie piante, herbe diverse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apriche collinette, ombrose valli,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Selve, e spelunche in <small>UNA VISTA</small> offerse:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E quel, che’l bello, e’l caro accresce &agrave; l’opre,<br /></span>

<span class="author"><span class="smcap">Tasso</span>, <small>C. XVI.</small> s. ix.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span></p>

<p>This, I say, may be the truest taste in gardening,
because the simplest: yet there is a
manifest regard to unity in the other method;
which has had its admirers, as it may have
again, and is certainly not without its <i>design</i>
and beauty.</p>

<p>But to return to our poet. Thus far he
drew from <i>Gothic</i> ideas; and these ideas, I
think, would lead him no further. But, as
<span class="smcap">Spenser</span> knew what belonged to classic composition,
he was tempted to tie his subject still
closer together by <i>one</i> expedient of his own,
and by <i>another</i> taken from his classic models.</p>

<p>His <i>own</i> was, to interrupt the proper story
of each book, by dispersing it into several; involving
by this means, and as it were intertwisting
the several actions together, in order
to give something like the appearance of one
action to his twelve adventures. And for this
conduct, as absurd as it seems, he had some
great examples in the <i>Italian</i> poets, though,
I believe, they were led into it by different
motives.</p>

<p>The <i>other</i> expedient, which he borrowed
from the classics, was, by adopting one superior
character, which should be seen throughout.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
Prince <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>, who had a separate adventure
of his own, was to have his part in each of the
other; and thus several actions were to be embodied
by the interest which one principal
Hero had in them all. It is even observable,
that <span class="smcap">Spenser</span> gives this adventure of Prince
<span class="smcap">Arthur</span>, in quest of <span class="smcap">Gloriana</span>, as the proper
subject of his poem. And upon this idea the
late learned editor of the <i>Fairy Queen</i> has attempted,
but, I think, without success, to defend
the unity and simplicity of its fable. The
truth was, the violence of classic prejudices
forced the poet to affect this appearance of
unity, though in contradiction to his <i>Gothic</i>
system. And, as far as we can judge of the
tenour of the whole work from the finished
half of it, the adventure of Prince <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>,
whatever the author pretended, and his critic
too easily believed, was but an after-thought;
and, at least, with regard to the <i>historical
fable</i>, which we are now considering, was only
one of the expedients by which he would conceal
the disorder of his <i>Gothic</i> plan.</p>

<p>And if this was his design, I will venture to
say that both his expedients were injudicious.
Their purpose was, to ally two things, in nature
incompatible, the <i>Gothic</i>, and the classic
unity; the effect of which misalliance was to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
discover and expose the nakedness of the
<i>Gothic</i>.</p>

<p>I am of opinion then, considering the <i>Fairy
Queen</i> as an epic or <i>narrative</i> poem constructed
on <i>Gothic</i> ideas, that the poet had
done well to affect no other unity than that of
<i>design</i>, by which his subject was connected.
But his poem is not simply narrative; it is
throughout <i>allegorical</i>: he calls it <i>a perpetual
allegory or dark conceit</i>: and this character,
for reasons I may have occasion to observe hereafter,
was even predominant in the <i>Fairy
Queen</i>. His narration is subservient to his
moral, and but serves to colour it. This he
tells us himself at setting out,</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fierce wars and faithful loves shall <i>moralize</i> my song;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>that is, shall serve for a vehicle, or instrument
to convey the moral.</p>

<p>Now under this idea, the <i>Unity</i> of the
<i>Fairy Queen</i> is more apparent. His twelve
knights are to exemplify as many virtues, out
of which one illustrious character is to be composed.
And in this view the part of Prince
<span class="smcap">Arthur</span> in each book becomes <i>essential</i>, and
yet not <i>principal</i>; exactly, as the poet has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
contrived it. They who rest in the literal
story, that is, who criticize it on the footing
of a narrative poem, have constantly objected
to this management. They say, it necessarily
breaks the unity of design. Prince <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>,
they affirm, should either have had no part in
the other adventures, or he should have had
the chief part. He should either have done
nothing, or more. This objection I find insisted
upon by <span class="smcap">Spenser’s</span> best critic<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>; and, I
think, the objection is unanswerable; at least,
I know of nothing that can be said to remove
it, but what I have supposed above might be
the purpose of the poet, and which I myself
have rejected as insufficient.</p>

<p>But how faulty soever this conduct be in the
literal story, it is perfectly right in the <i>moral</i>:
and that for an obvious reason, though his
critics seem not to have been aware of it. His
chief hero was not to have the twelve virtues
in the <i>degree</i> in which the knights had, each
of them, their own (such a character would be
a monster;) but he was to have so much of
each as was requisite to form his superior character.
Each virtue, in its perfection, is exemplified
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
in its own knight; they are all, in a
due degree, concentrated in Prince <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>.</p>

<p>This was the poet’s <i>moral</i>: and what way
of expressing this moral in the <i>history</i>, but by
making Prince <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> appear in each adventure,
and in a manner subordinate to its proper
hero? Thus, though inferior to each in his
own specific virtue, he is superior to all by
uniting the whole circle of their virtues in himself:
and thus he arrives, at length, at the
possession of that bright form of <i>Glory</i>, whose
ravishing beauty, as seen in a dream or vision,
had led him out into these miraculous adventures
in the land of Fairy.</p>

<p>The conclusion is, that, as an <i>allegorical</i>
poem, the method of the <i>Fairy Queen</i> is governed
by the justness of the <i>moral</i>: as a <i>narrative</i>
poem, it is conducted on the ideas and
usages of <i>Chivalry</i>. In either view, if taken
by itself, the plan is defensible. But from the
union of the two designs there arises a perplexity
and confusion, which is the proper,
and only considerable, defect of this extraordinary
poem.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span></p>

<h4 id="IX">LETTER IX.</h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">No</span> doubt, <span class="smcap">Spenser</span> might have taken one
single adventure, of the <span class="smcap">Twelve</span>, for the subject
of his Poem; or he might have given the
principal part in every adventure to Prince
<span class="smcap">Arthur</span>. By this means his fable had been
of the classic kind, and its unity as strict as
that of <span class="smcap">Homer</span> and <span class="smcap">Virgil</span>.</p>

<p>All this the poet knew very well; but his
purpose was not to write a classic poem. He
chose to adorn a <i>Gothic</i> story; and, to be consistent
throughout, he chose that the <i>form</i> of
his work should be of a piece with his subject.</p>

<p>Did the poet do right in this? I cannot tell:
but, comparing his work with that of another
great poet, who followed the system you seem
to recommend, I see no reason to be peremptory
in condemning his judgment.</p>

<p>The example of this poet deserves to be considered.
It will afford, at least, a fresh confirmation
of the point, I principally insist
upon, <i>the pre-eminence of the <span class="smcap">Gothic</span> manners</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
<i>and fictions, as adapted to the ends of poetry,
above the classic</i>.</p>

<p>I observed of the famous <span class="smcap">Torquato Tasso</span>,
that, coming into the world a little of the latest
for the success of the pure <i>Gothic</i> manner, he
thought fit to <i>trim</i> between that and the classic
model.</p>

<p>It was lucky for his fame, that he did so.
For the <i>Gothic</i> fables falling every day more
and more into contempt, and the learning of
the times, throughout all <i>Europe</i>, taking a
classic turn, the reputation of his work has
been chiefly founded on the strong resemblance
it has to the ancient <i>Epic</i> poems. His fable
is conducted in the spirit of the <i>Iliad</i>; and with
a strict regard to that unity of <i>action</i> which we
admire in <span class="smcap">Homer</span> and <span class="smcap">Virgil</span>.</p>

<p>But this is not all; we find a studied and
close imitation of those poets, in many of the
smaller parts, in the minuter incidents, and
even in the descriptions and similes of his
poem.</p>

<p>The classic reader was pleased with this deference
to the public taste: he saw with delight
the favourite beauties of <span class="smcap">Homer</span> and <span class="smcap">Virgil</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
reflected in the <i>Italian</i> poet; and was almost
ready to excuse, for the sake of these, his
magic tales and fairy enchantments.</p>

<p>I said, was <i>almost ready</i>; for the offence
given by these tales to the more fashionable
sort of critics was so great, that nothing, I believe,
could make full amends, in their judgment,
for such extravagancies.</p>

<p>However, by this means, the <i>Gierusalemme
Liberata</i> made its fortune amongst the <i>French</i>
wits, who have constantly cried it up above the
<i>Orlando Furioso</i>, and principally for this reason,
that <span class="smcap">Tasso</span> was more classical in his fable,
and more sparing in the wonders of <i>Gothic</i>
fiction, than his predecessor.</p>

<p>The <i>Italians</i> have indeed a predilection for
their elder bard; whether from their prejudice
for his subject; their admiration of his language;
the richness of his invention; the
comic air of his style and manner; or from
whatever other reason.</p>

<p>Be this as it will, the <i>French</i> criticism has
carried it before the <i>Italian</i>, with the rest of
<i>Europe</i>. This dextrous people have found
means to lead the taste, as well as set the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
fashions, of their neighbours: and <span class="smcap">Ariosto</span>
ranks but little higher than the rudest Romancer
in the opinion of those who take their notions
of these things from their writers.</p>

<p>But the same principle, which made them
give <span class="smcap">Tasso</span> the preference to <span class="smcap">Ariosto</span>, has
led them by degrees to think very unfavourably
of <span class="smcap">Tasso</span> himself. The mixture of the <i>Gothic</i>
manner in his work has not been forgiven. It
has sunk the credit of all the rest; and some
instances of false taste in the expression of his
sentiments, detected by their nicer critics,
have brought matters to that pass, that, with
their good will, <span class="smcap">Tasso</span> himself should now follow
the fate of <span class="smcap">Ariosto</span>.</p>

<p>I will not say, that a little national envy did
not perhaps mix itself with their other reasons
for undervaluing this great poet. They aspired
to a sort of supremacy in letters; and finding
the <i>Italian</i> language and its best writers standing
in their way, they have spared no pains to
lower the estimation of both.</p>

<p>Whatever their inducements were, they succeeded
but too well in their attempt. Our obsequious
and over-modest critics were run down
by their authority. Their taste of letters, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
some worse things, was brought among us at
the Restoration. Their language, their manners,
nay their very prejudices, were adopted
by our polite king and his royalists. And the
more fashionable wits, of course, set their
fancies, as my Lord <span class="smcap">Molesworth</span> tells us the
people of <i>Copenhagen</i> in his time did their
clocks, by the court-standard.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">W. Davenant</span> opened the way to this
new sort of criticism in a very elaborate preface
to <span class="smcap">Gondibert</span>; and his philosophic friend,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hobbes</span>, lent his best assistance towards
establishing the credit of it. These two fine
letters contain, indeed, the substance of whatever
has been since written on the subject.
Succeeding wits and critics did no more than
echo their language. It grew into a sort of
cant, with which <span class="smcap">Rymer</span>, and the rest of that
school, filled their flimsy essays and rambling
prefaces.</p>

<p>Our noble critic himself<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> condescended to
take up this trite theme: and it is not to be
told with what alacrity and self-complacency
he flourishes upon it. The <i>Gothic manner</i>, as
he calls it, is the favourite object of his raillery;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
which is never more lively or pointed,
than when it exposes that “bad taste which
makes us prefer an <span class="smcap">Ariosto</span> to a <span class="smcap">Virgil</span>,
and a Romance (without doubt he meant, of
<span class="smcap">Tasso</span>) to an <i>Iliad</i>.” Truly, this critical sin
requires an expiation; which yet is easily made
by subscribing to his sentence, “That the
French indeed may boast of legitimate authors
of a just relish; but that the <i>Italian</i>
are good for nothing but to corrupt the taste
of those who have had no familiarity with
the noble antients<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>.”</p>

<p>This ingenious nobleman is, himself, one of
the <i>gallant votaries</i> he sometimes makes himself
so merry with. He is perfectly enamoured
of his <i>noble ancients</i>; and will fight with any
man who contends, not that his Lordship’s
mistress is not fair, but that his own is fair
also.</p>

<p>It is certain the French wits benefited by
this foible. For pretending, in great modesty,
to have formed themselves on the pure taste of
his noble ancients, they easily drew his Lordship
over to their party: while the <i>Italians</i>,
more stubbornly pretending to a taste of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
own, and chusing to <i>lye</i> for themselves, instead
of adopting the authorised <i>lyes</i> of <i>Greece</i>,
were justly exposed to his resentment.</p>

<p>Such was the address of the <i>French</i> writers,
and such their triumphs over the poor <i>Italians</i>.</p>

<p>It must be owned, indeed, they had every
advantage on their side, in this contest with
their masters. The taste and learning of <i>Italy</i>
had been long on the decline; and the fine
writers under <span class="smcap">Louis XIV.</span> were every day advancing
the <i>French</i> language, such as it is
(simple, clear, exact, that is, fit for business
and conversation; but for that reason, besides
its total want of numbers, absolutely unsuited
to the genius of the greater poetry), towards
its last perfection. The purity of the ancient
manner became well understood, and it was
the pride of their best critics to expose every
instance of false taste in the modern writers.
The <i>Italian</i>, it is certain, could not stand so
severe a scrutiny. But they had escaped better,
if the most fashionable of the <i>French</i>
poets had not, at the same time, been their
best critic.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span></p>

<p>A lucky word in a verse, which sounds well
and every body gets by heart, goes further than
a volume of just criticism. In short, the exact,
but cold <span class="smcap">Boileau</span> happened to say something
of the <i>clinquant</i> of <span class="smcap">Tasso</span>; and the magic of
this word, like the report of <span class="smcap">Astolfo’s</span> horn
in <span class="smcap">Ariosto</span>, overturned at once the solid and
well-built reputation of the <i>Italian</i> poetry.</p>

<p>It is not perhaps strange that this potent
word should do its business in <i>France</i>. What
was less to be expected, it put us into a fright
on this side the water. Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, who
gave the law in taste here, took it up, and sent
it about the kingdom in his polite and popular
essays<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>. It became a sort of watchword among
the critics; and, on the sudden, nothing was
heard, on all sides, but the <i>clinquant</i> of <span class="smcap">Tasso</span>.</p>

<p>After all, these two respectable writers might
not intend the mischief they were doing. The
observation was just; but was extended much
further than they meant, by their witless followers
and admirers. The effect was, as I
said, that the <i>Italian</i> poetry was rejected in
the gross, by virtue of this censure; though
the authors of it had said no more than this,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
“that their best poet had some false thoughts,
and dealt, as they supposed, too much in
incredible fiction.”</p>

<p>I leave you to make your own reflexions on
this short history of the <i>Italian</i> poetry. It is
not my design to be its apologist in all respects.
However, with regard to the <i>first</i> of these
charges, I presume to say, that, as just as it
is in the sense in which I persuade myself it
was intended, there are more instances of natural
sentiment, and of that divine simplicity
we admire in the ancients, even in <span class="smcap">Guarini’s</span>
<i>Pastor Fido</i>, than in the best of the <i>French</i>
poets.</p>

<p>And as to the <i>last</i> charge, I pretend to shew
you, in my next Letter, that it implies no
fault at all in the <i>Italian</i> poets.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<h4 id="X">LETTER X.</h4>

<p class="drop"><i><span class="uppercase">Chi</span> non sa che cosa sia Italia?</i>&mdash;If this
question could ever be reasonably asked on
any occasion, it must surely be when the wit
and poetry of that people were under consideration.
The enchanting sweetness of their
tongue, the richness of their invention, the
fire and elevation of their genius, the splendour
of their expression on great subjects, and
the native simplicity of their sentiments on
affecting ones; all these are such manifest advantages
on the side of the <i>Italian</i> poets, as
should seem to command our highest admiration
of their great and capital works.</p>

<p>Yet a different language has been held by
our finer critics. And, in particular, you hear
it commonly said of the tales of <i>Fairy</i>, which
they first and principally adorned, “that they
are extravagant and absurd; that they surpass
all bounds, not of truth only, but of
probability; and look more like the dreams
of children, than the manly inventions of
poets.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span></p>

<p>All this, and more, has been said; and, if
truly said, who would not lament</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">L’arte del po&euml;tar troppo infelice?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>For they are not the cold fancies of plebeian
poets, but the golden dreams of <span class="smcap">Ariosto</span>, the
celestial visions of <span class="smcap">Tasso</span>, that are thus derided.</p>

<p>But now, as to the <i>extravagance</i> of these
fictions, it is frequently, I believe, much less
than these laughers apprehend.</p>

<p>To give an instance or two, of this sort.</p>

<p>One of the strangest circumstances in those
books, is that of the <i>women-warriors</i>, with
which they all abound. <span class="smcap">Butler</span>, in his <i>Hudibras</i>,
who saw it only in the light of a poetical
invention, ridicules it, as a most unnatural
idea, with great spirit. Yet in this representation,
they did but copy from the manners of
the times. <span class="smcap">Anna Comnena</span> tells us, in the
life of her father, that the wife of <span class="smcap">Robert</span> the
<i>Norman</i> fought side by side with her husband,
in his battles; that she would rally the flying
soldiers, and lead them back to the charge:
and <span class="smcap">Nicetas</span> observes, that, in the time of
<span class="smcap">Manuel Comnena</span>, there were in one Crusade
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
many women, armed like men, on horseback.</p>

<p>What think you now of <span class="smcap">Tasso’s</span> <i>Clarinda</i>,
whose prodigies of valour I dare say you have
often laughed at? Or, rather, what think you
of that constant pair,</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<span class="smcap">Gildippe</span> et <span class="smcap">Odoardo</span> amanti e sposi,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In valor d’arme, e in lealt&agrave; famosi?”<br /></span>
<span class="author"><small>C. III.</small> s. 40.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Again: what can be more absurd and incredible,
it is often said, than the vast armies
we read of in Romance? a circumstance, to
which <span class="smcap">Milton</span> scruples not to allude in those
lines of his <i>Paradise Regained</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>The classical reader is much scandalized on
these occasions, and never fails to cry out on
the impudence of these lying fablers. Yet if
he did but reflect on the prodigious swarms
which <i>Europe</i> sent out in the Crusades, and
that the transactions of those days furnished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
the Romance-writers with their ideas and
images, he would see that the marvellous in
such stories was modest enough, and did not
very much exceed the strict bounds of historical
representation.</p>

<p>The first army, for instance, that marched
for the Holy Land, even after all the losses it
had sustained by the way, amounted, we are
told, when it came to be mustered in the plains
of <i>Asia</i>, to no less than seven hundred thousand
fighting men: a number, which would
almost have satisfied the Romancer’s keenest
appetite for wonder and amplification.</p>

<p>A third instance may be thought still more
remarkable.</p>

<p>“We read perpetually of walls of fire raised
by magical art to stop the progress of knights-errant.
In <span class="smcap">Tasso</span>, the wizard <span class="smcap">Ismeno</span> guards
the inchanted forest with walls of fire. In
the <i>Orlando Inamorato</i>, <small>L. III.</small> c. i. <span class="smcap">Mandricardo</span>
is endeavoured to be stopped by
enchanted flames; but he makes his way
through all.”</p>

<p>Thus far the learned editor of the <i>Fairy
Queen</i> [Notes on <small>B. III. C.</small> xi. s. 25.] who contents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
himself, like a good Romance-critic, with
observing the fact, without the irreverence of
presuming to account for it. But if the profane
will not be kept within this decent reserve,
we may give them to understand, that this
fancy, as wild as it appears, had some foundation
in <i>truth</i>. For I make no question but
these <i>fires</i>, raised by magical art, to stop the
progress of assailants, were only the flames of
<small>FEUGREGEOIS</small>, as it was called, that is of <small>WILDFIRE</small>,
which appeared so strange, on its first
invention and application, in the barbarous ages.</p>

<p>We hear much of its wonders in the history
of the Crusades; and even so late as <span class="smcap">Spenser’s</span>
own time they were not forgotten. <span class="smcap">Davila</span>,
speaking of the siege of <i>Poitiers</i> in 1569, tells
us&mdash;&mdash;<i>Abbondavano nella citta le provisioni
da guerra; tra le quali, quantita inestimabile
di <small>FUOCHI ARTIFICIATI</small>, lavorati in diverse
maniere, ne’quali avenano i defensori posta
grandissima speranza di respingere gli assalti
de’nemici.</i> Lib. v.</p>

<p>Hence, without doubt, the <i>magical flames
and fiery walls</i>, of the <i>Gothic</i> Romancers<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
and who will say, that the <i>specious miracles</i>
of <span class="smcap">Homer</span> himself had a better foundation?</p>

<p>But, after all, this is not the sort of defence
I mean chiefly to insist upon. Let others explain
away these <i>wonders</i>, so offensive to certain
philosophical critics. They are welcome
to me in their own proper form, and with all
the extravagance commonly imputed to them.</p>

<p>It is true, the only criticism, worth regarding,
is that which these critics lay claim to,
the philosophical. But there is a sort which
looks like philosophy, and is not. May not
that be the case here?</p>

<p>This criticism, whatever name it deserves,
supposes that the poets, who are lyars by profession,
expect to have their lyes believed.
Surely they are not so unreasonable. They
think it enough, if they can but bring you to
<i>imagine</i> the possibility of them.</p>

<p>And how small a matter will serve for this?
A legend, a tale, a tradition, a rumour, a superstition;
in short, any thing is enough to be
the basis of their air-formed <i>visions</i>. Does
any capable reader trouble himself about the
truth, or even the credibility of their fancies?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
Alas, no; he is best pleased when he is made
to conceive (he minds not by what magic) the
existence of such things as his reason tells him
did not, and were never likely to, exist.</p>

<p>But here, to prevent mistakes, an explanation
will be necessary. We must distinguish
between the <i>popular belief</i>, and <i>that of the
reader</i>. The fictions of poetry do, in some
degree at least, require the <i>first</i> (they would,
otherwise, deservedly pass for <i>dreams</i> indeed):
but when the poet has this advantage on his
side, and his fancies have, or may be supposed
to have, a countenance from the current superstitions
of the age in which he writes, he
dispenses with the <i>last</i>, and gives his reader
leave to be as sceptical, and as incredulous, as
he pleases.</p>

<p>A fashionable <i>French</i> critic diverts himself
with imagining “what a person, who comes
fresh from reading Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span> and Mr.
<span class="smcap">Locke</span>, would be apt to think of <span class="smcap">Tasso’s</span>
Enchantments<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>.”</p>

<p>The <i>English</i> reader will, perhaps, smile at
seeing these two writers so coupled together:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
and, with the critic’s leave, we will put Mr.
<span class="smcap">Locke</span> out of the question. But if he be desirous
to know what a reader of Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>
would pronounce in the case, I can undertake
to give him satisfaction.</p>

<p>Speaking of what Mr. <span class="smcap">Dryden</span> calls, <i>the
Fairy way of writing</i>, “Men of cold fancies
and philosophical dispositions, says he, object
to this kind of poetry, that it has not
probability enough to affect the imagination.
But&mdash;many are prepossest with such false
opinions, as dispose them  to <i>believe</i> these
particular delusions: at least, we have all
<i>heard</i> so many pleasing relations in favour of
them, that we do not care for seeing through
the <i>falsehood</i>, and willingly give ourselves
up to so agreeable an imposture.” [<i>Spect.</i>
N<sup>o</sup> 419.]</p>

<p>Apply, now, this sage judgment of Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>
to <span class="smcap">Tasso’s</span> <i>Enchantments</i>; and you see
that a <i>falsehood convict</i> is not to be pleaded
against a <i>supposed belief</i>, or even the <i>slightest
hear-say</i>.</p>

<p>So little account does this wicked poetry
make of philosophical or historical truth: all
she allows us to look for, is <i>poetical truth</i>; a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
very slender thing indeed, and which the poet’s
eye, when rolling in a <i>fine frenzy</i>, can but
just lay hold of. To speak in the philosophic
language of Mr. <span class="smcap">Hobbes</span>, it is something much
<i>beyond the actual bounds, and only within the
conceived possibility of nature</i>.</p>

<p>But the source of bad criticism, as universally
of bad philosophy, is the abuse of terms.
A poet, they say, must follow <i>nature</i>; and by
nature we are to suppose can only be meant
the known and experienced course of affairs
in this world. Whereas the poet has a world
of his own, where experience has less to do,
than consistent imagination.</p>

<p>He has, besides, a supernatural world to
range in. He has Gods, and Fairies, and
Witches, at his command: and,</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;O! who can tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hidden <i>pow’r</i> of herbes, and might of magic spell?<br /></span>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">Spenser</span>, <small>B. V. C.</small> ii.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thus, in the poet’s world, all is marvellous
and extraordinary; yet not <i>unnatural</i> in one
sense, as it agrees to the conceptions that are
readily entertained of these magical and wonder-working
natures.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span></p>

<p>This trite maxim of <i>following Nature</i> is
further mistaken, in applying it indiscriminately
to all sorts of poetry.</p>

<p>In those species which have men and manners
professedly for their theme, a strict conformity
with human nature is reasonably demanded.</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Non hic Centauros, non Gorgonas, Harpyiasque<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Invenies: hominem pagina nostra sapit;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>is a proper motto to a book of epigrams; but
would make a poor figure at the head of an
epic poem.</p>

<p>Still further in those species that address
themselves to the heart, and would obtain their
end, not through the <i>imagination</i>, but through
the <i>passions</i>, there the liberty of transgressing
nature, I mean the real powers and properties
of human nature, is infinitely restrained; and
<i>poetical</i> truth is, under these circumstances,
almost as severe a thing as <i>historical</i>.</p>

<p>The reason is, we must first <i>believe</i> before
we can be <i>affected</i>.</p>

<p>But the case is different with the more
sublime and creative poetry. This species,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
addressing itself solely or principally to the
Imagination; a young and credulous faculty,
which loves to admire and to be deceived; has
no need to observe those cautious rules of credibility,
so necessary to be followed by him
who would touch the affections and interest
the heart.</p>

<p>This difference, you will say, is obvious
enough: How came it then to be overlooked?
From another mistake, in extending a particular
precept of the drama into a general maxim.</p>

<p>The <i>incredulus odi</i> of <span class="smcap">Horace</span> ran in the
heads of these critics, though his own words
confine the observation singly to the stage:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quam qu&aelig; sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus, et qu&aelig;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ipse sibi tradit Spectator&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>That, which passes in <i>representation</i>, and
challenges, as it were, the scrutiny of the eye,
must be truth itself, or something very nearly
approaching to it. But what passes in <i>narration</i>,
even on the stage, is admitted without
much difficulty&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">multaque tolles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ex oculis, qu&aelig; mox narret facundia presens.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span></p>

<p>In the epic narration, which may be called
<i>absens facundia</i>, the reason of the thing shews
this indulgence to be still greater. It appeals
neither to the <i>eye</i> nor the <i>ear</i>, but simply to
the <i>imagination</i>, and so allows the poet a
liberty of multiplying and enlarging his impostures
at pleasure, in proportion to the easiness
and comprehension of that faculty<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>.</p>

<p>These general reflexions hardly require an
application to the present subject. The tales
of Fairy are exploded, as fantastic and incredible.
They would merit this contempt, if presented
on the stage; I mean, if they were
given as the proper subject of dramatic imitation,
and the interest of the poet’s plot were to
be wrought out of the adventures of these marvellous
persons. But the epic muse runs no
risque in giving way to such fanciful exhibitions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span></p>

<p>You may call them, as one does, “extraordinary
dreams, such as excellent poets and
painters, by being over-studious, may have
in the beginning of fevers<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>.”</p>

<p>The epic poet would acknowledge the charge,
and even value himself upon it. He would
say, “I leave to the sage dramatist the merit
of being always broad awake, and always in
his senses. The <i>divine dream</i><a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>, and delirious
fancy, are among the noblest of my prerogatives.”</p>

<p>But the injustice done the <i>Italian</i> poets does
not stop here. The cry is, “Magic and enchantments
are senseless things. Therefore
the <i>Italian</i> poets are not worth the reading.”
As if, because the superstitions of <span class="smcap">Homer</span> and
<span class="smcap">Virgil</span> are no longer believed, their poems,
which abound in them, are good for nothing.</p>

<p>Yes, you will say, their fine pictures of life
and manners&mdash;</p>

<p>And may not I say the same, in behalf of
<span class="smcap">Ariosto</span> and <span class="smcap">Tasso</span>? For it is not true that
all is <i>unnatural</i> and monstrous in their poems,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
because of this mixture of the wonderful. Admit,
for example, <span class="smcap">Armida’s</span> marvellous conveyance
to the happy Island; and all the rest
of the love-story is as natural, that is, as suitable
to our common notions of that passion, as
any thing in <span class="smcap">Virgil</span> or (if you will) <span class="smcap">Voltaire</span>.</p>

<p>Thus, you see, the apology of the <i>Italian</i>
poets is easily made on every supposition. But
I stick to my point, and maintain that the
Fairy tales of <span class="smcap">Tasso</span> do him more honour than
what are called the more natural, that is, the
classical parts of his poem. His imitations of
the ancients have indeed their merit; for he
was a genius in every thing. But they are
faint and cold, and almost insipid, when compared
with his <i>Gothic</i> fictions. We make a
shift to run over the passages he has copied
from <span class="smcap">Virgil</span>. We are all on fire amidst the
magical feats of <span class="smcap">Ismen</span>, and the enchantments
of <span class="smcap">Armida</span>.</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Magnanima mensogna, hor quando &egrave; il vero<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Si bello, che si possa &agrave; te preporre?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>I speak at least for myself; and must freely
own, if it were not for these <i>lyes</i> of <i>Gothic</i> invention,
I should scarcely be disposed to give
the <i>Gierusalem Liberata</i> a second reading.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

<p>I readily agree to the lively observation,
“That impenetrable armour, inchanted castles,
invulnerable bodies, iron men, flying horses,
and other such things, are easily feigned by
them that dare<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>.” But, with the observer’s
leave, not so feigned as we find them in the
<i>Italian</i> poets, unless the writer have another
quality, besides that of courage.</p>

<p>One thing is true, that the success of these
fictions will not be great, when they have no
longer any footing in the popular belief: and
the reason is, that readers do not usually do as
they ought, put themselves in the circumstances
of the poet, or rather of those of whom the
poet writes. But this only shews, that some
ages are not so fit to write epic poems in, as
others; not, that they should be otherwise
written.</p>

<p>It is also true, that writers do not succeed so
well in painting what they have heard, as what
they believe, themselves, or at least observe in
others a facility of believing. And on this account
I would advise no modern poet to revive
these Fairy tales in an epic poem. But still
this is nothing to the case in hand, where we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
are considering the merit of epic poems, written
under other circumstances.</p>

<p>The Pagan Gods and <i>Gothic</i> Fairies were
equally out of credit when <span class="smcap">Milton</span> wrote. He
did well therefore to supply their room with
Angels and Devils. If these too should wear
out of the popular creed (and they seem in a
hopeful way, from the liberty some late critics
have taken with them) I know not what other
expedients the epic poet might have recourse
to; but this I know, the pomp of verse, the
energy of description, and even the finest moral
paintings, would stand him in no stead.
Without <i>admiration</i> (which cannot be affected
but by the marvellous of celestial intervention,
I mean, the agency of superior natures really
existing, or by the illusion of the fancy taken
to be so) no epic poem can be long-lived.</p>

<p>I am not afraid to instance in the <i>Henriade</i>
itself; which, notwithstanding the elegance of
the composition, will in a short time be no
more read than the <i>Gondibert</i> of Sir <span class="smcap">W. Davenant</span>,
and for the same reason.</p>

<p>Critics may talk what they will of <i>Truth
and Nature</i>, and abuse the <i>Italian</i> poets as
they will, for transgressing both in their incredible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
fictions. But, believe it, my friend,
these fictions with which they have studied to
delude the world, are of that kind of creditable
deceits, of which a wise ancient pronounces
with assurance, “<i>That they, who deceive, are
honester than they who do not deceive; and
they, who are deceived, wiser than they who
are not deceived.</i>”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span></p>

<h4 id="XI">LETTER XI.</h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">But</span> you are weary of hearing so much of
these exploded fancies; and are ready to ask,
if there be any truth in this representation,
“Whence it has come to pass, that the classical
manners are still admired and imitated
by the poets, when the <i>Gothic</i> have long
since fallen into disuse?”</p>

<p>The answer to this question will furnish all
that is now wanting to a proper discussion of
the present subject.</p>

<p>One great reason of this difference certainly
was, that the ablest writers of <i>Greece</i> ennobled
the system of heroic manners, while it was
fresh and flourishing; and their works, being
master-pieces of composition, so fixed the
credit of it in the opinion of the world, that no
revolutions of time and taste could afterwards
shake it.</p>

<p>Whereas the <i>Gothic</i> having been disgraced
in their infancy by bad writers, and a new set
of manners springing up before there were any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
better to do them justice, they could never be
brought into vogue by the attempts of later
poets; who yet, in spite of prejudice, and for
the genuine charm of these highly poetical
manners, did their utmost to recommend them.</p>

<p>But, <small>FURTHER</small>, the <i>Gothic</i> system was not
only forced to wait long for real genius to do
it honour; real genius was even very early
employed against it.</p>

<p>There were two causes of this mishap. The
old Romancers had even outraged the truth in
their extravagant pictures of Chivalry; and
Chivalry itself, such as it once had been, was
greatly abated.</p>

<p>So that men of sense were doubly disgusted
to find a representation of things <i>unlike</i> to
what they observed in real life, and <i>beyond</i>
what it was ever possible should have existed.
However, with these disadvantages, there was
still so much of the old spirit left, and the
fascination of these wondrous tales was so prevalent,
that a more than common degree of
sagacity and good sense was required to penetrate
the illusion.</p>

<p>It was one of this character, I suppose, that
put the famous question to <span class="smcap">Ariosto</span>, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
has been so often repeated that I shall spare
you the disgust of hearing it. Yet long before
his time an immortal genius of our own (so
superior is the sense of some men to the age
they live in) saw as far into this matter, as
<span class="smcap">Ariosto’s</span> examiner.</p>

<p>You will, perhaps, be as much surprised, as
I was (when, many years ago, the observation
was, first, made to me) to understand, that
this sagacious person was <span class="smcap">Dan Chaucer</span>; who
in a reign that almost realized the wonders of
Romantic Chivalry, not only discerned the absurdity
of the old Romances, but has even ridiculed
them with incomparable spirit.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">His Rime of Sir Topaz</span> in the <i>Canterbury</i>
Tales (said the curious observer, on whose
authority I am now building) is a manifest banter
on these books, and may be considered as
a sort of prelude to the adventures of Don
<span class="smcap">Quixote</span>. I call it <i>a manifest banter</i>: for we
are to observe that this was <span class="smcap">Chaucer’s</span> own
tale; and that, when in the progress of it the
good sense of the Host is made to break in
upon him, and interrupt him, <span class="smcap">Chaucer</span> approves
his disgust, and, changing his note,
tells the simple instructive tale of <span class="smcap">Meliboeus</span>;
<i>a moral tale virtuous</i>, as he terms it; to shew,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
what sort of fictions were most expressive of
real life, and most proper to be put into the
hands of the people.</p>

<p>It is, further, to be noted, that the tale of
<i>the Giant</i> <span class="smcap">Olyphant</span> <i>and Chylde</i> <span class="smcap">Topaz</span> was
not a fiction of his own, but a story of antique
fame, and very celebrated in the days of Chivalry:
so that nothing could better suit the
poet’s design of discrediting the old Romances,
than the choice of this venerable legend for the
vehicle of his ridicule upon them.</p>

<p>But what puts the satyric purpose of <i>the Rime
of Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Topaz</span> out of all question, is, that this
short poem is so managed as, with infinite humour,
to expose the leading impertinencies of
books of Chivalry; the very <i>same</i>, which <span class="smcap">Cervantes</span>
afterwards drew out, and exposed at
large, in his famous history.</p>

<p>Indeed Sir <span class="smcap">Topaz</span> is all Don <span class="smcap">Quixote</span> in
little; as you will easily see from comparing
the two knights together; who are drawn with
the same features, are characterized by the
same strokes, and differ from each other but
as a sketch in miniature from a finished and
full-sized picture.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span></p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Cervantes</span> is very particular in describing
the <i>person</i> and <i>habit</i> of his Hero, agreeably to
the known practice of the old Romancers.
<span class="smcap">Chaucer</span> does the same by his knight, and in
a manner that almost equals the arch-gravity
of the <i>Spanish</i> author:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sir <span class="smcap">Topaz</span> was a doughty swaine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White was his face as paine maine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His lippes red as rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rudde is like scarlet in graine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I you tell in good certaine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>He had a seemely nose</i>.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His haire, his berde, was like safroune,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That to his girdle raught adowne,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His shoone of cordewaine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Bruges were his hosen broun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His robe was of chekelatoun,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That cost many a jane.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Cervantes</span> tells us how Don <span class="smcap">Quixote</span>
passed his time in the country, before he turned
Knight-errant. <span class="smcap">Chaucer</span>, in the same spirit,
celebrates his knight’s country diversions of
<i>hunting</i>, <i>hawking</i>, <i>shooting</i>, and <i>wrestling</i>,
those known <i>prolusions</i> to feats of arms:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He couth hunt at the wilde dere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ride an hauking for by the rivere<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
<span class="i2">With grey <span class="smcap">Goshauke</span> on honde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereto he was a good archere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wrastling was there none his pere<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There any Ram should stonde.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>3. The Knights of Romance were used to
dedicate their services to some paragon of
beauty, such as was only conceived to exist in
the land of Fairy, and could no where be found
in this vulgar disenchanted world. Hence one
of the strongest features in Don <span class="smcap">Quixote’s</span>
character is the sublime passion he had conceived
for an imaginary or fairy mistress. Sir
<span class="smcap">Topaz</span> is not behind him in this extravagance:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An Elfe-queene woll I love, I wis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in this world no woman is<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To be my make in towne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All other women I forsake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to an Elfe-queene I me take<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By dale and eke by downe.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>4. Don <span class="smcap">Quixote’s</span> passion for this idol of
his fancy was so violent, that, after all the
bangs and bruises of the day, instead of suffering
his weary limbs to take any rest, it occupied
him all night with incessant dreams and
reveries of his mistress. Sir <span class="smcap">Topaz</span> is in the
same woful plight:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span></p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sir <span class="smcap">Topaz</span> eke so weary was&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That down he laid him in that place&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, Saint <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, benedicite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What aileth this love at me<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To blind me so sore?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me dreamed all this night parde<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An Elfe-queen shall my leman be<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sleepe under my gore.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>5. As the chastity of the hero of <span class="smcap">La Mancha</span>
is well known, from a variety of trying
temptations, so Sir <span class="smcap">Topaz</span> distinguishes himself
by this knightly virtue:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Full many a maide bright in boure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They mourne for him their paramoure.<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Whan hem were bet to sleepe</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he was chaste and no lechoure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet as is the bramble floure<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That bereth the red hipe.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>6. The fight of Sir <span class="smcap">Topaz</span> with the Giant of
three heads, in honour of his mistress,</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For needes must he fight<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a giant with heads thre,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For paramours and jolitie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one that shone full bright&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>together with his arming, and the whole ridiculous
preparation for the combat, described at
large in several stanzas, is exactly in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
style and taste of <span class="smcap">Cervantes</span>, on similar occasions.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Cervantes</span> gives us to understand that
it was familiar with his knight to sleep in the
open air, to endure all hardships that befell,
and to let his horse graze by him. <span class="smcap">Chaucer</span>,
in like manner, of his knight, with much humour:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And for he was a knight auntrous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He nolde slepen in none house<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But liggen in his hood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bright helme was his wanger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by him fed his destrer<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of herbes fine and good.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>8. And, lastly, as <span class="smcap">Cervantes</span>, after the example
of the Romance-writers, will have it,
that his knight surpasses all others of ancient
fame, so <span class="smcap">Dan Chaucer</span> is careful to vindicate
this high prerogative, to his hero:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Men speaken of Romances of pris<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of <span class="smcap">Hornechild</span> and of <span class="smcap">Ipotis</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of <span class="smcap">Bevis</span> and Sir <span class="smcap">Gie</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Sir <span class="smcap">Libeaux</span> and <span class="smcap">Blandamoure</span>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sir <span class="smcap">Topaz</span>, he beareth the floure<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of rial chivalrie.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span></p>

<p>Thus far, at least to this effect, the concealed
author (for the dispensers of these
fairy favours would not be inquired after) of
this new interpretation of the <i>Rime of Sir</i>
<span class="smcap">Topaz</span>. Other circumstances of resemblance
might be added (for when a well-grounded
hint of this sort is once given, and opened in
some instances, it is not difficult to pursue it),
but one needs go no further to be certain that
the general scope of this poem is, Burlesque.</p>

<p>Only, I would observe, that though, in
this ridiculous ballad, the poet clearly intended
to expose the Romances of the time, as they
were commonly written, he did not mean,
absolutely and under every form, to condemn
the kind of writing itself: as, I think, we
must conclude from the serious air, and very
different conduct, of the <span class="smcap">Squire’s tale</span>; which
<span class="smcap">Spenser</span> and <span class="smcap">Milton</span> were so particularly
pleased with.</p>

<p>We learn too, from the same tale, that,
though <span class="smcap">Chaucer</span> could be as pleasant on the
other fooleries of Romance, as any modern
critic, he let the <i>marvellous</i> of it escape his
ridicule, or rather esteemed this character of
the <i>Gothic</i> Romance, no foolery. For the tale
of <span class="smcap">Cambuscan</span> is all over <span class="smcap">Marvellous</span>; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
<span class="smcap">Milton</span>, by specifying the <i>virtuous ring and
glass</i>, and the <i>wondrous horse of brass</i>, as the
circumstances that charmed him  most, shews
very plainly, that, in his opinion, these
amusing fictions were well placed, and of principal
consideration, as they surely are, in this
<i>Fairy way of writing</i>.</p>

<p>But, whatever our old Bard would insinuate
by his management of this enchanting tale,
and whatever conclusions have, in fact, been
drawn from it by such superior and congenial
spirits as our two epic poets, the <i>half-told</i>
story of <span class="smcap">Cambuscan</span> could never atone for the
mischiefs done to the cause of Romance, by
the pointed ridicule of <i>the Rime of Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Topaz</span>.
Common readers would be naturally induced
by it to reject the old Romances, in the gross:
and thus it happened, according to the observation
I set out with, “that these phantoms
of Chivalry had the misfortune to be laughed
out of countenance by men of sense, before
the substance of it had been fairly and truly
represented by any capable writer.”</p>

<p>Still, the principal cause of all, which
brought disgrace on the <i>Gothic</i> manners of
Chivalry, no doubt, was, That these manners,
which sprang out of the feudal system, were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
as singular, as that system itself: so that when
that political constitution vanished out of <i>Europe</i>,
the manners, that belonged to it, were
no longer seen or understood. There was no
example of any such manners remaining on
the face of the earth: and as they never did
subsist but once, and are never likely to subsist
again, people would be led of course to
think and speak of them, as romantic, and
unnatural. The consequence of which was a
total contempt and rejection of them; while
the classic manners, as arising out of the customary
and usual situations of humanity,
would have many archetypes, and appear natural
even to those who saw nothing similar to
them actually subsisting before their eyes.</p>

<p>Thus, though the manners of <span class="smcap">Homer</span> are
perhaps as different from ours, as those of Chivalry
itself, yet as we know that such manners
always belong to rude and simple ages, such as
<span class="smcap">Homer</span> paints; and actually subsist at this day
in countries that are under the like circumstances
of barbarity; we readily agree to call
them <i>natural</i>, and even take a fond pleasure
in the survey of them.</p>

<p>Your question then is easily answered, without
any obligation upon me to give up the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
<i>Gothic</i> manners as visionary and fantastic. And
the reason appears, why the <i>Fairy Queen</i>,
one of the noblest productions of modern
poetry, is fallen into so general a neglect, that
all the zeal of its commentators is esteemed
officious and impertinent, and will never restore
it to those honours which it has, once
for all, irrecoverably lost.</p>

<p>In effect, what way of persuading the generality
of readers that the romantic manners
are to be accounted <i>natural</i>, when not one in
ten-thousand knows enough of the barbarous
ages, in which they arose, to believe they ever
really existed?</p>

<p>Poor <span class="smcap">Spenser</span> then,</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;“in whose gentle spright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pure well-head of Poesie did dwell,”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>must, for aught I can see, be left to the admiration
of a few lettered and curious men:
while the many are sworn together to give no
quarter to the <i>marvellous</i>, or, which may seem
still harder, to the <i>moral</i> of his song.</p>

<p>However, this great revolution in modern
taste was brought about by degrees; and the
steps, that led to it, may be worth the tracing
in a distinct Letter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span></p>

<h4 id="XII">LETTER XII.</h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> wonders of Chivalry were still in the
memory of men, were still existing, in some
measure, in real life, when <span class="smcap">Chaucer</span> undertook
to expose the barbarous relaters of them.</p>

<p>This ridicule, we may suppose, hastened
the fall both of Chivalry and Romance. At
least from that time the spirit of both declined
very fast, and at length fell into such discredit,
that when now <span class="smcap">Spenser</span> arose, and with a genius
singularly fitted to immortalize the land
of Fairy, he met with every difficulty and disadvantage
to obstruct his design.</p>

<p>The age would no longer bear the naked
letter of these amusing stories; and the poet
was so sensible of the misfortune, that we find
him apologizing for it on a hundred occasions.</p>

<p>But apologies, in such circumstances, rarely
do any good. Perhaps, they only served to
betray the weakness of the poet’s cause, and to
confirm the prejudices of his reader.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span></p>

<p>However, he did more than this. He gave
an air of mystery to his subject, and pretended
that his stories of knights and giants were but
the cover to abundance of profound wisdom.</p>

<p>In short, to keep off the eyes of the prophane
from prying too nearly into his subject, he
threw about it the mist of allegory: he moralized
his song: and the virtues and vices lay
hid under his warriors and enchanters. A contrivance
which he had learned indeed from his
<i>Italian</i> masters: for <span class="smcap">Tasso</span> had condescended
to allegorise his own work; and the commentators
of <span class="smcap">Ariosto</span> had even converted the extravagances
of the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, into moral
lessons.</p>

<p>And this, it must be owned, was a sober
attempt in comparison of some projects that
were made about the same time to serve the
cause of the old, and now-expiring Romances.
For it is to be observed, that the idolizers of
those Romances did by them, what the votaries
of <span class="smcap">Homer</span> had done by him. As the times
improved and would less bear his strange tales,
they <i>moralized</i> what they could, and turned the
rest into mysteries of <i>natural science</i>. And as
this last contrivance was principally designed
to cover the monstrous stories of the <i>Pagan</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
<i>Gods</i>, so it served the lovers of Romance to
palliate the no less monstrous stories of <i>magic
enchantments</i>.</p>

<p>The editor or translator of the 24th book of
<span class="smcap">Amadis de Gaule</span>, printed at <i>Lyons</i> in 1577,
has a preface explaining the whole secret,
which concludes with these words, “Voyla,
lecteur, le <small>FRUIT</small>, qui se peut recueiller du
sens mystique des Romans antiques par les
<small>ESPRITS ESLEUS</small>, le commun peuple soy contentant
de la <small>SIMPLE FLEUR DE LA LECTURE
LITERALE</small>.”</p>

<p>But to return to <span class="smcap">Spenser</span>; who, as we have
seen, had no better way to take in his distress,
than to hide his fairy fancies under the mystic
cover of moral allegory. The only favourable
circumstance that attended him (and this no
doubt encouraged, if it did not produce, his
untimely project) was, that he was somewhat
befriended in these fictions, even when interpreted
according to the Letter, by the Romantic
Spirit of his age; much countenanced,
and for a time brought into fresh credit, by the
Romantic <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>. Her inclination for the
fancies of Chivalry is well known; and obsequious
wits and courtiers would not be wanting,
to feed and flatter it. In short, tilts and tournaments
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
were in vogue: the <i>Arcadia</i> and the
<i>Fairy Queen</i> were written.</p>

<p>With these helps the new spirit of Chivalry
made a shift to support itself for a time, when
reason was but dawning, as we may say, and
just about to gain the ascendant over the portentous
spectres of the imagination. Its growing
splendour, in the end, put them all to flight,
and allowed them no quarter even among the
poets. So that <span class="smcap">Milton</span>, as fond as we have
seen he was of the <i>Gothic</i> fictions, durst only
admit them on the bye, and in the way of
simile and illustration only.</p>

<p>And this, no doubt, was the main reason of
his relinquishing his long-projected design of
Prince <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>, at last, for that of the <i>Paradise
Lost</i>; where, instead of Giants and Magicians,
he had Angels and Devils to supply
him with the <i>marvellous</i>, with greater probability.
Yet, though he dropped the tales, he
still kept to the allegories of <span class="smcap">Spenser</span>. And
even this liberty was thought too much, as appears
from the censure passed on his <i>Sin and
Death</i> by the severer critics.</p>

<p>Thus at length the magic of the old Romances
was perfectly dissolved. They began
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
with reflecting an image indeed of the feudal
manners, but an image magnified and distorted
by unskilful designers. Common sense being
offended with these perversions of truth and
nature (still accounted the more monstrous, as
the antient manners, they pretended to copy
after, were now disused, and of most men forgotten),
the next step was to have recourse to
<i>allegories</i>. Under this disguise they <i>walked
the world</i> a while; the excellence of the moral
and the ingenuity of the contrivance making
some amends, and being accepted as a sort of
apology, for the absurdity of the literal story.</p>

<p>Under this form the tales of Fairy kept their
ground, and even made their fortune at court;
where they became, for two or three reigns,
the ordinary entertainment of our princes.
But reason, in the end (assisted however by
party, and religious prejudices), drove them
off the scene, and would endure these <i>lying
wonders</i>, neither in their own proper shape,
nor as masked in figures.</p>

<p>Henceforth, the taste of wit and poetry took
a new turn: and the <i>Muse</i>, who had wantoned
it so long in the world of fiction, was now constrained,
against her will,</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“To stoop with disenchanted wings to truth,”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>

<p>as Sir <span class="smcap">John Denham</span> somewhere expresses her
present enforced state, not unhappily.</p>

<p>What we have gotten by this revolution,
you will say, is a great deal of good sense.
What we have lost, is a world of fine fabling;
the illusion of which is so grateful to the
<i>charmed Spirit</i>, that, in spite of philosophy
and fashion, <i>Fairy</i> <span class="smcap">Spenser</span> still ranks highest
among the poets; I mean, with all those who
are either come of that house, or have any
kindness for it.</p>

<p>Earth-born critics, my friend, may blaspheme:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">“But all the <span class="smcap">Gods</span> are ravish’d with delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his celestial song, and music’s wondrous might.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

 This was the talk of men at that time. It was perhaps
in the king’s intention. But the design, if it had
ever been formed, miscarried; as the Bishop himself observes
in his History&mdash;“The most melancholy part of the
treaty of <i>Ryswick</i> was, that no advantages were got by
it, in favour of the Protestants in <i>France</i>.” Vol. iv. p.
295. <i>Edinb.</i> 1753.&mdash;Whether the blame of this lies in the
king, or his parliaments, or neither, the reader is left to
judge for himself, from considering the state and transactions
of those times.</p></div>

 These rigours the bishop gives a particular account
of in <small>THE HISTORY OF HIS OWN TIMES</small>, vol. iii. <i>Edinb.</i>
1753.&mdash;Speaking of the persecution of the <i>French</i> Protestants,
he says, “I went over a great part of <i>France</i>,
while it was in its hottest rage, from <i>Marseilles</i> to
<i>Montpelier</i>, and from thence to <i>Lyons</i>, and so on to
<i>Geneva</i>. I saw and knew so many instances of their
injustice and violence, that it exceeded even what could
have been well imagined; for all men set their thoughts
on work to invent new methods of cruelty. In all the
towns through which I passed, I heard the most dismal
accounts of things possible.” p. 60.&mdash;Again&mdash;“The
fury that appeared on this occasion did spread itself
with a sort of contagion: for the intendants and other
officers, that had been mild and gentle in the former
parts of their life, seemed now to have laid aside the
compassion of Christians, the breeding of gentlemen,
and the impressions of humanity.” p. 61.</p></div>

patent with a <i>non-obstante</i> in it. “Quod cum comperisset,”
says the historian, “ab alto ducens suspiria, de

 The doctrines of divine right, as propagated by the
churchmen of that time in their books and sermons, are
well known.&mdash;Those of the lawyers were such as these&mdash;It
had been alleged on the part of Mr. <span class="smcap">Hampden</span>, in the
great cause of ship-money, “that by a fundamental policy
in the creation of the frame of this kingdom, in case the
monarch of <i>England</i> should be inclined to exact from his
subjects at his pleasure, he should be restrained, for that
he could have nothing from them, but upon a common
consent of parliament.” Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Berkeley</span>, one of
the judges of the king’s-bench, affirmed&mdash;“That the law
knows no such king-yoking policy:”&mdash;Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Trevor</span>,
one of the barons of the exchequer, “That our king
hath as much power and prerogative belonging to him as
any prince in Christendom:”&mdash;The attorney-general, Sir
<span class="smcap">John Banks</span>, “That the king of <i>England</i> hath an entire
empire; he is an absolute monarch: nothing can be given
to an absolute prince! but is inherent in his person.”
<i>State Trials</i>, vol. i. Such was the language of the guardians
of the <small>LAW</small>, that temple or sanctuary, as it has been
called, whither the subject is to run for shelter and protection.
Had not Mr. <span class="smcap">St. John</span> then much reason for
saying, as he did on that occasion, “We have the fabric
of the temple still; but the Gods, the <span class="smcap">Dii Tutelares</span>, are
gone?” There is the more force and propriety in this
censure, as it comes from a man who was himself of the
profession. And another of the same order, the best and
wisest perhaps that frequented the temple of law in those
days, proceeds with a just indignation still further&mdash;“These
men (said Mr. <span class="smcap">Hide</span>, in a speech to the lords)
have, upon vulgar fears, delivered up the precious forts
they were trusted with, almost without assault; and, in a
tame easy trance of flattery and servitude, lost and forfeited
(shamefully forfeited) that reputation, awe, and reverence,
which the wisdom, courage, and gravity of their
venerable predecessors had contracted and fastened to their
places; and have even rendered that study and profession,
which in all ages hath been, and I hope now shall be, of
honourable estimation, so contemptible and vile, that, had
not this blessed day come [the day of impeachment of the
six judges], all men would have had that quarrel to the
Law itself, which <span class="smcap">Marcius</span> had to the <i>Greek</i> tongue, who
thought it a mockery to learn that language, the masters
whereof lived in bondage under others.”&mdash;Thus these eloquent
apologists for law and liberty. The conclusion is,
that though in the great bodies of churchmen and lawyers,
some will always be found to dishonour themselves, there
have never been wanting others to do justice to the public,
and to assert, maintain, and preserve, the dignity of their
respective professions.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">33</a>
 This appears even from Mr. <span class="smcap">Hume’s</span> own account of
the feudal times; incomparably the best part of his <i>History
of England</i>. And it is to be presumed that, if so ingenuous
a writer had begun his work at the right end, he
would have been led, by the evidence of so palpable a
truth, to express himself more favourably, indeed more
consistently, of the <i>English</i> constitution. But having, by
some odd chance, written the history of the <span class="smcap">Stuarts</span> first,
and afterwards of the <span class="smcap">Tudors</span>, (in both which he found
it for his purpose to adopt the notion of a despotic independent
spirit in the <i>English</i> monarchy), he chuses in the
last part of his work, which contains the history of <i>England
from</i> <span class="smcap">Julius C&aelig;sar</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Henry VII.</span> to abide by his
former fancy; on this pretence, that, in the administration
of the feudal government, the liberty of the subject
was incomplete and partial; often precarious and uncertain:
a way, in which the learned historian might prove,
that no nation under heaven ever was, or ever will be,
possessed of a <small>FREE CONSTITUTION</small>.
</p>
<p>
By the <small>FREE CONSTITUTION</small> of the <i>English</i> monarchy,
every advocate of liberty, that understands himself, I suppose,
means, that limited plan of policy, by which the
supreme legislative power (including in this general term
the power of levying money) is lodged, not in the prince
singly, but jointly in the prince and people; whether the
<i>popular</i> part of the constitution be denominated <i>the king’s</i>
or <i>kingdom’s great council</i>, as it was in the proper feudal
times; or <i>the parliament</i>, as it came to be called afterwards;
or, lastly, <i>the two houses of parliament</i>, as the
style has now been for several ages.
</p>
<p>
To tell us, that this constitution has been different at
different times, because the regal or popular influence has
at different times been more or less predominant, is only
playing with a word, and confounding <i>constitution</i> with
<i>administration</i>. According to this way of speaking, we
have not only had <i>three or four</i><a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>, but possibly three or
four score, different constitutions. So long as that great
distribution of the supreme authority took place (and it
has constantly and invariably taken place, whatever other
changes there might be, from the <i>Norman</i> establishment
down to our times) the nation was always enabled, at
least <i>authorized</i>, to regulate all subordinate, or, if you
will, supereminent claims and pretensions. This it effectually
did at the <i>Revolution</i>, and, by so doing, has not
created a <i>new plan of policy</i>, but perfected the old one.
The great <small>MASTER-WHEEL</small> of the <i>English</i> constitution is
still the same; only freed from those checks and restraints,
by which, under the specious name of <i>prerogatives</i>, time
and opportunity had taught our kings to obstruct and embarrass
its free and regular movements.
</p>
<p>
On the whole, it is to be lamented that Mr. <span class="smcap">Hume</span>’s too
zealous concern for the honour of the house of <span class="smcap">Stuart</span>,
operating uniformly through all the volumes of his history,
has brought disgrace on a work, which, in the main, is
agreeably written, and is indeed the most readable <i>general</i>
account of the <span class="smcap">English</span> affairs, that has yet been given to
the public.</p></div>

as long as the frame of it shall stand; and being maintained
in purity and vigour, will preserve it from the

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
